 BENIN- The Committee of Benin Elders has called on the people of the ancient city to come out enmasse to vote in the March 11 House of Assembly election in the state. The committee made this appeal on Tuesday in Benin via a statement jointly issued by its Chairman and Secretary, retired Gen. Godwin Abbe, and Dr O. Asemota, respectively. The elders appealed to everyone to continue to be law abiding and peaceful, while discharging the civic responsibility. “The Committee of Benin Elders has reviewed the current situation nationwide, especially the unfolding political developments and perceived disquiet in a segment of the society. “The Committee wishes to appeal to everyone to continue to be law abiding and peaceful. “We urge our people to discharge their civic duties by going out massively to vote according to the dictates of their conscience in the forthcoming elections slated for Saturday the 11th of March, 2023. “The Committee pleads with all relevant authorities at the national and state levels to continue to remain neutral, provide an environment that is conducive for voting and protect the lives of citizens, which will all give credibility to the process,” the statement read in part. The elders, however, urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be impartial and to follow the electoral laws strictly, to deliver a credible outcome which would engender confidence in Nigerians and the international community.
