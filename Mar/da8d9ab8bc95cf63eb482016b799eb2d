OWERRI – The Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, on Saturday, sacked the Commissioner for Labour and Productivity, Ford Ozumba amidst the face-off between the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Imo State Government. Ozumba’s dismissal which is with immediate effect, is contained in a statement signed and made available to journalists by the Commissioner for Information, Declan Emelumba. The Governor is said to have directed Ozumba to hand over all necessary documents to the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Productivity immediately. No reason was given for the sack but some sources say it may not be unconnected with the ongoing impasse between the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) led by Joe Ajaero and the Imo State Government. Sources within the Labour Union told JOURNALIST101 that Ozumba might have been a casualty of the election by the workers which was allegedly truncated by the agents of the state government. The source said the former Commissioner was poised for a free and fair election by the union which didn’t go down well with some powerful forces at the Douglas House. “I’m sure Ozumba was axed for subtly albeit, unknowingly siding with the workers in the state to have a free and fair election without the interference of the Imo State Government,” the source who doesn’t want his name mentioned for fear of victimisation told our correspondent.
