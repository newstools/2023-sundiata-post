Lagos – 1,671 Permanent Voters Cards have been recovered from an apartment in Olodi-Apapa area of Lagos State by personnel of the 9 Brigade of the Nigerian Army. While three persons were arrested in the apartment, the prime suspect is reportedly on the run. The security operatives also recovered ballot papers, cutlasses and Indian hemp from the apartment. The Brigade Commander, Brig. Gen. Isang Akpaumontia, who paraded the suspects and recovered PVCs, ballot papers and other items before journalists at the Ikeja Cantonment, said the arrest and recovery were made following a tip-off. Most of the recovered PVCs had the year 2022 as the registration number, while others had years 2011, 2012 and 2021 with all the owners being residents of Lagos State. Akpaumontia said; “Earlier today (yesterday), three young men were arrested with 1,671 PVCs.  This was after early information was received. With the support of the Department of State Services, DSS, we were able to arrest them.  “They were arrested with some drugs, dagger, charms and over 1,000 PVCs.  They were arrested at the Apapa general area, in a house where we traced them to. The owner of the house, who is the prime suspect, was traced to a hotel. But he took off.  “We are going to hand these suspects and exhibits over to our immediate headquarters to do the needful because things have to be done the way they should, so as to discourage others who think they can take laws into their hands and go scot-free.”
