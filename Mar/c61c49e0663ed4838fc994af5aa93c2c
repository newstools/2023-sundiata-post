Senator Shehu Sani has likened the relationship between Rivers state governor Nyesom Wike and the presidential candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi, to that of a man who is trying to be nice to a lady who he jilted with the aim of still being in a good relationship with her. He shared this opinion on his Twitter handle on Saturday, March 11. Recall that some Nigerians and supporters of the Labour Party, LP, felt governor Wike worked against the interest of Obi in favour of Tinubu during the 2023 presidential election, an action Wike has denied. On Saturday, March 11,, Gov Wike praised Obi and described him as being the Hero of the 2023 presidential election. Wike said Obi’s decision to contest the election changed the dynamics of the 2023 presidential election and that Obi’s participation ensured that power was not retained in the North. In an apparent reaction to Governor Wike’s comment, Senator Sani wrote, “Wike and Peter. Is like trying to be nice in order to continue a relationship with a lady you jilted, after marrying another.”
