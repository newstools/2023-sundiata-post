By NICHOLAS DECHI MAKURDI- A former presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Moses Ayom, has appealed to Benue residents to replicate the victory recorded by the party in the Presidential and National Assembly elections on March 11. Ayom made the call while inaugurating the Independent Campaign Council (ICC) in support of Rev. Fr Hyacinth Alia for governor of the state in Makurdi. “I commend the people of Benue people, especially those from the Benue North East Senatorial District, for playing a major role in APC’s ‘political earthquake’ which consumed other parties. “The landslide victory was achieved largely due to the pragmatic leadership style of Sen. George Akume, the leader of the party in the state. “I appeal that you repeat the same during the Governorship and State Assembly polls by voting for  Rev Fr Alia, to usher in, the desired Benue where people’s interest will occupy the centre stage,” Ayom said. He said that it was his utmost desire to ensure that Alia emerged victorious with a landslide victory during the governorship election. “This is the reason why I came up with the ICC to canvass support for Alia and all APC candidates, ahead of the mega gubernatorial campaign rallies which would hold in the three senatorial districts. He assured that he was poised to work for the overwhelming success of the party in the last round of the general elections, so that the state would witness a turn around in its political history. He further congratulated the President-elect, Sen. Bola Tinubu, on his victory and appealed to him to support the emergence of someone from the Middle-Belt to succeed him as Nigeria’s President at the end of his eight years in office. (NAN)
