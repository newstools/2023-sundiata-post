LAFIA- Mr Obiya Yahaya-Doma, Chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Nasarawa State has called on the electorate to vote for David Ombugadu, the PDP gubernatorial candidate during Saturday’s election.The chieftain of the party who is from Doma Local Government Area (LGA) of the state, made the call at a news conference in Lafia on Wednesday.According to Yahaya-Doma, the call became imperative because of the competence and blueprint of the PDP candidate to transform the state and set it on the part of development.He explained that Ombugadu had proven records of achievements as a two-term House of Representatives member for Akwanga/Nassarawa-Eggon/Wamba Federal Constituency from 2011-2019.He added that Ombugadu, while in the National Assembly, facilitated employment of many youths, attracted projects, including healthcare centres, schools and electricity to his constituency.“He had also provided boreholes to all the electoral wards of the state, even those outside his constituency also benefited from his representation.“If someone can do these much as House of Representatives Member, just imagine what he will do when elected as the Governor,” he added.He said also that the PDP candidate, in his early 40s, had done so much, as such it was high time the youth should be given the opportunity to lead the state.When asked if it was reasonable for APC members to support a candidate of another party, Yahaya-Doma said President Muhammadu Buhari had publicly declared that Nigerians should support candidates of their choice based on competence.“I am not doing anything wrong because the President, who is the leader of our party, openly said that the people should vote for any candidate of their choice,” he added.He added that the APC administration in the state had failed the people and performed below average and expectations.The APC Chieftain therefore appealed to the residents of the state to shun religious and ethnic politics for the overall development of the state. (NAN)
