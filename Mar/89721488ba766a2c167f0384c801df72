By HADIZA MOHAMMED TEHRAN- Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Monday described a wave of suspected poison attacks on girls in dozens of schools as an “unforgiveable crime.” Khameneion said: “The perpetrators of this crime must be severely punished. There will be no amnesty for such people.” This was the first time that Khamenei, who has the final say in all major state matters, has commented on the poisonings that have worried parents across the country. The first cases of mysterious illnesses were reported in November. Since then, hundreds of schoolgirls, in exclusive girls’ schools, have been treated in hospitals across the country. Parents and relatives are outraged and angry, especially as there is still no official explanation. Iran’s government believes the girls are being deliberately poisoned, perhaps by groups opposed to girls’ education. Doctors have suggested some sort of toxic gas could be the source of the attacks.
