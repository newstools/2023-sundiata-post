The state government described the claim as “wicked and mischievous”, adding that the accident victims were speedily evacuated to LASUTH where they were attended to outside the emergency centre to classify their injuries which is a normal medical procedure in an emergency. It was further disclosed that the survivors have since undergone various stages of treatment and admitted into wards.
