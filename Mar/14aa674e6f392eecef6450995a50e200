ABUJA – A large number of supporters of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, on Wednesday staged a protest at the Federal Capital Territory, over alleged manipulation of the Saturday election. The protesters, who are largely youths, converged at the Unity Fountain, Abuja on Wednesday morning to demand the cancellation of the alleged altered presidential election results. The Labour Party’s National Campaign Manager, Isaac Balami who spoke with DAILY POST at the protest ground, alleged that the party agents have results different from what the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC announced. He said, “We are here to activate the process of getting back out stolen mandate. We believe and we have it on record that APC did not win this election. “We have our results. The results they announced are not what our agents have. We are not here to fight, we are here to tell the whole world that our mandate has been stolen and we are not going just sit at home and cry”.
