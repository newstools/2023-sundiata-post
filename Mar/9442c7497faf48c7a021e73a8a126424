ABUJA (Sundiata Post) – Dr. Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, the running mate of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has offered reasons why the silence of his principal was unsettling the All Progressives Congress. Baba-Ahmed made the reasons known in a series of tweets on his Twitter handle on Wednesday morning. This came hours after the Independent National Electoral Commission declared the candidate of the APC for the February 25, 2023 polls in Nigeria, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as the President-Elect. Baba-Ahmed said the strident calls by the APC for Obi, a former two-term Governor of Anambra State, to congratulate Tinubu was so they could know his mind on the outcome of the poll. He said Obi’s continued silence was making the ruling party uncomfortable. He tweeted: “Peter Obi is quiet and this right there is killing APC. “They don’t know what Obi is thinking hence you have been seeing tweets from them saying ‘Make the call and congratulate Asiwaju’. “Peter Obi will never do that.” Baba-Ahmed then gave an inkling that the Labour Party would be contesting the outcome of the election. He added to his tweet: “Like I said, fasten your seat belt. It’s going to be a long ride.” Recall that the party had during the election told its supporters to gather every piece of evidence that could be used to fight any manner of injustice or breach of the rules of the election, especially in Lagos State. One of the strong voices in the party and member of the Labour Party Presidential Campaign Council, Aisha Yesufu, in a series of videos and tweets, confirmed that the party was already gathering facts with which to prosecute its case in court. The party itself had thrown the challenge to its supporters nationwide. Both Yesufu and the party asked them to gather the materials in all formats: Photographs, videos and audios. (TheEagleonline)
