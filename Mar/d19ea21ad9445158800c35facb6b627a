ABUJA – The court of appeal has granted the Independent National Electoral Commission’s request to reconfigure the bimodal voter accreditation system (BVAS) ahead of the governorship and state assembly elections. In the ruling delivered on Wednesday, a three-member panel of the court of appeal led by Joseph Ikyegh, held that restraining the electoral commission would hamper the conduct of March 11th elections by INEC. In an application, Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), had sought an order of the court “restraining the 1st respondent (INEC) from tampering with the information embedded in the BVAS machines until the due inspection is conducted and certified true copies (CTC) of them issued”.
