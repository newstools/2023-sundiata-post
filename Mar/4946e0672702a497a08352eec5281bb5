ABUJA- Mrs Ibim Semenitari, Director, New Media, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Campaign Council for Rivers governorship election, says the state will become an investment hub in Africa, if Siminalayi Fubara is elected governor of the state. Semenitari, in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, said that Fubara stood tall among others jostling for the governorship seat in the state. According to her, Fubara’s policies, as contained in his manifesto, titled ‘A Blueprint for a Greater Rivers State’ will bring the much-needed change and development to the state. Semenitari further stated that it would also bring improved infrastructure, job opportunities and better access to health care and education. “Fubara’s policy outline plans to create greater economic opportunities by providing tax incentives to businesses and expanding access to health care and education,’’ she said. This, she said, was by investing in the public sector and improving infrastructure and by investing in roads, ports and other projects. According to Semenitari, the 38-page manifesto prioritises agriculture, industrialisation, infrastructure, education and healthcare. She said that the five areas of focus were intended to drive economic growth and development, create jobs and reduce poverty in the state. Semenitari said these were key elements for the state to achieve its vision for the future, adding that Fubara would make the state an investment destination in Africa, with the implementation of the manifesto. She said that the governorship candidate had also resolved to improve infrastructure, promote economic development and create a conducive environment for investments. She commended Fubara for his commitment to making the state a competitive destination for foreign direct investments. (NAN)
