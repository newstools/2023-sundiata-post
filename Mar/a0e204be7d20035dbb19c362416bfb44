Lagos, – An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, on Friday, ordered the remand of one Onyeka Nwafor, 24,  over alleged armed robbery and rape. Nwafor, who resides at Redemption street, Jagemo in Ikotun area of Lagos, is facing a four-count charge, bothering on armed robbery and rape. The Magistrate, Mrs E. Kubeinje, however, did not take the plea of the defendant due to lack of jurisdiction. She directed the police to send the case file to the state Director of Public Prosecution for advice. Kubeinje, thereafter, adjourned the case till March 28 for mention. The Prosecutor, DSP Kehinde Ajayi, told the court that Nwafor committed the offences on Aug. 20, 2022 at Bashiru Shittu street, Magodo Phase II, Lagos. She said that the defendant and some others now at large, while armed with dangerous weapons and a toy revolver pistol, attacked one Mr Henry Ajayi at his phone shop and stole eight mobile phones, all valued at N5 million. Ajayi added that the defendant also attacked a 30-year-old lady (name withheld), raped her and dispossessed her of phones, a laptop, money and other valuables. The offences, according to her, contravene Sections 260, 297, 298 and 299 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Section 260 of the criminal law stipulates life imprisonment for anyone found guilty of having sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent.
