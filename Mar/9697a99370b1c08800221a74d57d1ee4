KADUNA- The Sir Ahmadu Bello Memorial Foundation has congratulated the president-Elect, Sen. Bola Tinubu, over his victory in the 2023 Presidential Election as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). This is contained in a statement, signed by the Director General of the foundation, Mr Abubakar Umar, and made available to newsmen in Kaduna on Monday. Umar said the Foundation noted the acceptance speech made by the president-elect, revealing “we call on him to be magnanimous in victory by being accommodating, all-embracing and running an all-inclusive government. “While believing that his previous experiences in public service, both as a former Governor and a Senator, will propel him towards enhancing greater unity and peace in Nigeria,” he said. The Foundation also recognises the contributions of all the Presidential Candidates in conducting the most robust issues-based and violent -free campaigns.
