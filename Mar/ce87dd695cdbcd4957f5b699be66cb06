By ADELEYE ADEYEMI LAGOS- Chief Stanley Osifo, a former APC Presidential aspirant, on Friday  appealed to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and Mr Peter Obi to support the President-elect, Sen. Bola Tinubu, to move Nigeria forward. Abubakar and Obi, the presidential candidates of the PDP and Labour Party, respectively, had vowed to challenge the outcome of the Feb. 25 Presidential poll in court. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Sen. Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was on Wednesday declared winner of the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Osifo, in a statement in Lagos, said that Tinubu won the election as declared by INEC. He said, “Tinubu is willing to accommodate everyone that has genuine interest in the positive Nigerian project plan execution. “Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar, including other candidates that lost in the Presidential and National Assembly elections, should join hands with Bola Tinubu in moving Nigeria forward”. According to him, both PDP and LP are making false claims about winning the presidential election. “Both of them are making false claims to electoral victory. APC won the 2023 Presidential election that was conducted on Feb. 25 in Nigeria. “INEC conducted the election, declared the winner and has given certificate of return to the winner and President-elect,” Osifo said.
