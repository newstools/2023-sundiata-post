By ABBAS BAMALLI KATSINA- The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Katsina State has dismissed insinuations that its governorship candidate, Sen Yakubu Lado-Danmarke, has withdrawn from the race. Alhaji Kabir Yusuf-Yar’adu, the Chairman of the PDP campaign media committee, disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday in Katsina. “The attention of the PDP Campaign Council in Katsina State has been drawn to a fake press release circulating that the party’s gubernatorial candidate has withdrawn his candidature. “PDP wishes to state that the press release is fake and untrue. The director campaign to the candidate,  Dr Mustapha Inuwa, has never endorsed any letter carrying the letter headed paper of the PDP. “The campaign council has its own headed paper which it issues press releases on. Similarly, PDP campaign council wishes to advise people of the state to disregard the fake press release. “The fake press release was a clear desperation of the ruling party, APC, to discredit the PDP gubernatorial candidate who is by the day gaining popularity from the electorate,” Yusuf said. “I wish to state that the PDP gubernatorial candidate is very much in the race. “Only this evening, he received hundreds of Labour Party loyalists who intend to support him, another indication that he is very much in the race.” He pointed out that the PDP gubernatorial candidate had also received academic and non-academic staff of tertiary institutions in Katsina State who pledged to support his candidature. The PDP campaign council therefore urged people of the state to disregard the press release. (NAN)
