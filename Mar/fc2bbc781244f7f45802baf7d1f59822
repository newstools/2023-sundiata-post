KADUNA- The National Secretary of Action Democratic Party (ADP), Victor Fingesi, has refuted the insinuations that the party is in alliance with other political parties in Kaduna in respect of the forthcoming Governorship elections. Fingesi made the declaration in a statement on Wednesday in Kaduna. According to him, the insinuations making the round that the party’s gubernatorial candidate in Kaduna, Sani Sha’aban, was in alliance and had stepped down to support candidate of another party, is false. Fingesi added that the claim was no doubt intended to malign the good name of the party and its gubernatorial candidate as regards the governorship elections. “Without a doubt, the candidate of our great party, Sani Sha’aban being thechoice of the great people of Kaduna State, remains the candidate to beat at the polls. “It is unfortunate in this age that certain political players would resort to such extreme measures to discredit his person or cause confusion in the polity,” Fingesi said. The ADP Secretary stated that Sha’aban was in the race to win the governorship of Kaduna State, and had not stepped down for any other candidate in the state. “Sha’aban has never asked his teemingsupporters to align themselves with any gubernatorial candidate. “For emphasis, we reiterate that he is very much in the race as the candidate of the ADP in the Kaduna State Governorship Election,” he said. The National Secretary urged all the party faithful and the people of Kaduna State to disregard the rumour, and see it as fake news. He also appealed to all the members of the party and the general public to come out in their numbers to support the party and its candidate in the elections, to restore the dignity, peace and development that Kaduna State needed.(NAN)
