LAGOS (Sundiata Post) â€“ Akere Market, a spare parts market used mainly by Igbos in the Olodi Apapa area of Lagos, went up in flames in the early hours of Wednesday (today). It is a large market in Lagos that generates considerable revenue for the state government. Though no one has claimed responsibility for the attack but Sundiata Post understands that the cause of the fire outbreak might not be unconnected with the charged political atmosphere arising from the struggle over who wins the March 11 governorship election in Lagos State. The two leading candidates are the incumbent Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of the All Progressives Congress and Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour of the Labour Party.
