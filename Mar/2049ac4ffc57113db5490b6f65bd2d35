DELTA- Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta says he will continue to support the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, Mr Sheriff Oborevwori. He told newsmen in Asaba on Monday that his decision was premised on the fact that Oborevwori was democratically elected at the party’s primary election. He recalled that Oborevwori scored 597 votes to emerge victorious at the primary election held on May 25, 2022, while his closest rival, Mr David Edevbie polled 113 votes. “I will continue to support the candidacy of Oborevwori. There was a primary conducted in which he scored 590 votes to emerge winner so he is my choice. “We are in a democracy where people make choices. Oborevwori was chosen by the people so I will continue to support him,’’ he said. The governor described himself as product of a democratic course and recalled that in 2015 he went through a democratic process to emerge as PDP’s candidate. “I promised to push democratic process forward by ensuring free and fair elections in the state,’’ he said. Speaking on mass defection by the PDP members in Delta to the All Progressive Congress (APC), Okowa said that everyone had right to defect. He argued that some members of the APC in the state were also defecting to the PDP. On the “Obidient Movement’’ the governor said the membership was not about the Labour Party. “Many factors led to the emergence of the movement which included religion, the argument that the Igbo must produce the next president and the quest that the presidency should shift to the South,’’ he said. Giving his stewardship, Okowa said his administration had constructed more than 1,000 kilometres of storm drainage and more than 2,000 roads, bridges, and schools. (NAN)
