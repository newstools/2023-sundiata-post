SEONGNAM (SOUTH KOREA)- A former Chief of Staff to South Korean opposition Leader, Lee Jae-Myung, who wassuspected to have committed suicide, urged the Democratic Party (DP) chair to quit politics, in his suicide note. This is according to information by the officials, on Friday. The deceased, surnamed Jeon, was also said to have complained about being investigated by prosecutors in connection with Lee’s corruption allegations. Jeon had served as Lee’s Chief Secretary during his term as the Mayor of Seongnam, which is south of Seoul. He later became Lee’s first Chief of Staff after Lee was elected Governor of Gyeonggi Province in 2018. Jeon was found dead at his home in Seongnam at 6:45 p.m. on Thursday. Police said they had yet to find any sign of foul play in his death. According to the officials, a six-page suicide note apparently written by Jeon was found at the scene. Jeon reportedly said in the note that he worked hard but felt wronged after becoming a target of the prosecution’s investigation. He was also quoted as telling Lee to leave politics, saying there should be no more sacrifices. Jeon’s family has refused to disclose the note. The family reportedly said that he was stressed out as his name was mentioned in recent media reports on Lee’s corruption allegations. The DP leader has blamed prosecution for Jeon’s death, during a party meeting. He said that Jeon might have been under heavy pressure due to prosecutors’ investigation and alleged creation of manipulated evidence. However, prosecution said that Jeon was questioned only once, on Dec. 26, 2022. (Yonhap/NAN)
