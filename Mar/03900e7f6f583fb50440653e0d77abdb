Media personality Dotun, better known as Do2dtun, made a tweet to call out Desmond Elliot for non-performance and this led to a clash with a follower. Just days before the House of Assembly election, Desmond Elliot, a lawmaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Surulere Constituency, bought 8 transformers for communities in his constituency. This sparked criticisms online as many accused Desmond of doing very little for his community, only to suddenly start working as he seeks reelection. Dotun took to Twiiltter to write: “Desmond that couldn’t buy a power bank for his constituency suddenly buys 8 transformers all at once few days to the election. Isn’t it obvious that these guys don’t care. Desmond! Import and export.” A follower hit back as Dotun, writing: “I thought you get sense before Dotun. Go to surulere and verify.” And Dotun slammed the follower as he tweeted, “Na your papa no get sense. How Desmond and your papa take relate, you go tell me. Ode, I be Surulere boy born and bred, so take a seat fes.”
