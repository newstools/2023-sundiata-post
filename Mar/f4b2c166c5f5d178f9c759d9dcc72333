The pastor expressed optimism that the nation would experience prosperity and divine healing to restore its lost glory. She urged all to come out en-masse during the gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections on Saturday and exercise their franchise for good governance. Phillips also called on those at the helms of affairs to prioritise the welfare of the masses. She appealed to the Central Bank of Nigeria to ensure flow of cash into circulation, to alleviate the current hardship being experienced by Nigerians, due to cash scarcity. According to her, the seventh edition of the ”Healing Streams Live Healing Service with Pastor Chris Oyakhilome” will feature prayers for the healing of the nation. Quoting from the Book of Jeremiah 33:6, Phillips expressed the hope that God promises of restoration would be actualised in the country. She also said that the Healing Streams Live Healing Service, slated for March 17 to March 19 would minister healing to many sick people around the world. The pastor encouraged everyone to register, prayerfully prepare and be a part of the programme with full expectation for the miraculous. She said that the programme, which had recorded several testimonies from past editions held, was another opportunity to pray for nations across the world and witness God’s outstretched hand to those direly in need of healing in their bodies.
