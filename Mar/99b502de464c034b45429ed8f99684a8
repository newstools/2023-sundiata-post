Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has granted his first interview since the 2023 presidential election was wrapped with All Progressives Congress’ candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu being declared winner. Appearing for an interview on Arise TV, Obi stated that the declared winner of 2023 presidential election did not win. The Labour presidential candidate who averred that he didn’t contest in the election to help anyone win, also stated that the declared winner of the election failed to win the people. On why he chose to challenge the election in court, Obi said they are challenging the rascality displayed by the Independent National Electoral Commission in the election. According to him, INEC, as a public institution, should always submit itself to scrutiny from Nigerians. He said; “INEC is a public institution and it should be open. Because if you do something and people are not satisfied then you should be able to open up yourself. “INEC has conducted an election and announced the winner but I am only asking that I have access to the materials that were used to arrive at the result. I am not asking you to change what you said. “I’m not challenging their declaration. Or rather, I am not challenging who they declared. I am not challenging whatever the outcome is. I’m challenging the process by which they arrived at their declaration. “And unless we do that, we are not going to stop the rascality we witnessed in that election. The process through which people come into the office is far more fundamental than what they do thereafter. “There is a process of doing things, of arriving at every destination. A process is important.” Watch a video from the interview below……………………………………………….. A post shared by Lindaikejiblog (@lindaikejiblogofficial)
