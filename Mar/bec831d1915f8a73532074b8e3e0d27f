ABUJA – Peter Obi, presidential candidate of Labour Party, said on Monday that his support for Labour Party governorship and State Assembly candidates for Saturday’s election is total and 100%. Obi who spoke in answer to a question at Arise Television programme, said emphatically that all Labour Party candidates who got the ticket through the normal process enjoy his total commitment and support and he is urging the people to vote for them on Saturday. He mentioned in particular states like Enugu (Hon. Chijioke Edeoga), Lagos (Gbadebo Patrick Rhodes-Vivour), Abia (Alex Otti), Delta (Deacon Ken Pela), Kaduna, (Johnathan Asake) Plateau (Dr. Sunday Patrick Dakum), among others whom he is urging Obidients in these states to give them maximum support on Saturday because with them a foundation for a new Nigeria of our dream will be realised. The LP flag bearer also disclosed that in some states where Labour Party has no flag bearer, the Obidient should identify and vote for competent persons in other parties who have character and capacity and who share in the aspiration of a new Nigeria. He said that there are still some Nigerians in other political parties who believe in the Obidient aspirations, pointing out that such people should be fished where we have no candidate and vote for them.
