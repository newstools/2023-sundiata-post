By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Kaduna Senator, Comrade Shehu Sani has raised the alarm saying that mosques and churches have deviated from preaching unity and love but instead had become dangerous political platforms for generating hate, transmitting hate and distributing hate. The Social crusader lamented that this is tantamount to lighting up a candle close to a Gas station. He disclosed this on Tuesday when he took to his Twitter handle page @ShehuSani. Earlier he had tweeted that the people of Northern Kaduna and those of Southern Kaduna will unite, irrespective of the divisive campaign by paid Religious fanatics and terminate the rule of tyranny and terror in the state. Adding that they did it on the 25th of February and they shall do it on the 11th of March Insha Allah. The tweets read: “Mosques and Churches have deviated from preaching unity, peace and love; they have now become dangerous political platforms for generating hate, transmitting hate and distributing hate. We are lighting up a candle close to a Gas station.” “We the people of Northern Kaduna and those of Southern Kaduna will unite,irrespective of the divisive campaign by paid Religious fanatics & terminate the rule of tyranny & terror in the state.We did it on the 25th of February and we shall do it on the 11th of March Insha Allah.” Mosques and Churches have deviated from preaching unity,peace and love;they have now become dangerous political platforms for generating hate,transmitting hate and distributing hate.We are lighting up a candle close to a Gas station.
