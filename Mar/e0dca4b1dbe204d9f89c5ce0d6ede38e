Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The National Chairman of the Labour Party, Julius Abure has dissolved the party’s State Executive Council in Rivers State for alleged anti-party activities and corruption in the management of party’s funds. Abure, in a statement on Tuesday, said the dissolution is with immediate effect. He said those “who were at the helm of affairs in Rivers State when our presidential mandate was openly stolen in Rivers State should step aside until full investigation is completed on what happened on that day”. Abure said he has lost confidence in the ability of the compromised State Executive Council led by Deinye Pepple to lead the campaign for the governorship and  State House of Assembly elections come March 11. He urged all Obidients in the state to disregard all comments and actions by Pepple. Abure said Beatrice Itubo remains the Labour Party candidate for the Saturday’s governorship election in the state. The chairman also said the Labour Party has not formed an alliance with any political party. Hours before, Pepple endorsed the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Siminialayi Fubara for Saturday’s election, saying he is supporting a young and vibrant candidate who is from the South-East Senatorial District that has not produced a governor in the state.
