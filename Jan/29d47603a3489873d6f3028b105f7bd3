ABUJA – Popular Nigerian musician, Paul Okoye of the P-Square group has slammed the Nigerian Senate for acting as the mouthpiece of the poor masses only when their interests are at stake. Paul, who goes by the stage name Rudeboy, made the comment in reaction to the call by the Senate on the Central Bank of Nigeria to extend the deadline for the exchange of the old naira notes. The Senate had directed the CBN to shift the deadline to the end of June while the speaker of the House of Representatives went further by threatening to issue warrant of arrest for the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, and the managing director of any commercial bank that fails to honour the invitation by the House to discuss the matter. Writing via his known social media accounts, the singer wondered why the lawmakers maintained willful blindness during the pandemic when people were hungry and palliatives were being hidden by the same government. “And where were y’all when Nigerians were hungry during pandemic ? Instead y’all were hiding palliative…. All of a sudden you are fighting for economy … Dear Nigerians the money they have accumulated for vote buying is useless that why they are crying,” he tweeted on Sunday. During the pandemic, people were hungry, where was the Senate when the palliative were discovered? Same government were hiding food for their citizens, they were silent and dumb because it doesn’t affect them. “Now, with the CBN naira redesign they became spokesmen for the poor because it affects them. Imagine there was no election… Aswear they won’t say pim!!!” The singer and his brother have been very vocal in their support for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi and have used all the platforms to promote his campaign. They also performed during one of his rallies.
