The commissioner promised to keep Plateau residents updated on the commission’s level of preparedness and emerging issues. The state chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Fr. Polycarp Lubo in his remark, urged the public to get their voters card. According to him, the voters card remain the only tool they have to get the change they desire.
