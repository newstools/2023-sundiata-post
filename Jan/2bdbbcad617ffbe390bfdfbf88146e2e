By Hauwa GoldAbuja, – A lawyer, Akpoviroro Daniel, who allegedly seized solar equipment valued at N13.5 million over a purported debt, on Thursday appeared before a Grade 1 Area Court in Karu, Abuja. The defendant, whose address was given as No. 211 Karu Federal Housing Estate, Abuja, is facing trial for mischief and theft. The Prosecution Counsel, Mr Olanrewaju Osho, told the court that the matter was reported at the Asokoro Police Station by one Michael Bright of No. 16, Ajayi Crowther St., Asokoro, Abuja. Osho informed the court that the complainant alleged that sometime in August, 2022, the defendant went to his shop, forced the door open and stole one big solar generator, two small solar generators and six lithium batteries all valued at N13.5 million. The offence, he said, contravenes the provisions of Section 327 and 288 of the Penal Code. He said that during the police investigation, the defendant was traced and arrested and informed to the police that he took the items in place of N1.9 million the complainant owed him. The Judge, Mr Umar Mayana admitted the defendant to N500,000 bail with two sureties and ordered that he should deposit N500,000 with the court registrar as restitution to the complainant. Mayan also directed that the sureties must live within the court’s jurisdiction and one of who should be an Executive member of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) where the lawyer is registered. He further ordered that the sureties should provide valid means of identification and their addresses must be verified by an officer from the Asokoro Police Division. He adjourned the case until Feb. 9 for mention. (NAN)
