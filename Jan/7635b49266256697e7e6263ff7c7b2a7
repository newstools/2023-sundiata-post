Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has slammed the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, over the new monetary policy. The CBN in December 2022, introduced the newly redesigned N200, N500, and N1000 notes and has said they will cease to be legal tenders by February 10. In a post shared on his Instagram page this morning, FFK opined that Emefiele has ”weaponised the CBN and is an enemy of democracy.” He called for the cancellation of the new Naira notes policy until after the elections. He wrote; ”Emefiele has weaponised the CBN and is an enemy of democracy.The policy of cancelling old notes must be totally cancelled until AFTER the election and then done lawfully.He wants to cause a crisis, provoke a people’s uprising, derail our democracy and pave the way for an ING.He has NO plans to release enough new naira notes any time soon.He wants to STARVE the people of cash and drive them to rage out of frustration.This is not about politics but about stoking up protest and revolution. This is subversion and destablisation.He must be stopped and caged!(FFK)” (LINDA IKEJI)
