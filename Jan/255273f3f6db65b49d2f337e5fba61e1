By Blessing IbegbuAbuja, – A Karu Upper Area Court, Abuja, on Thursday, sentenced a 35-year-old man, Emeka Boniface, to two months’ imprisonment for smoking Indian hemp. The Judge, Ishaq Hassan, however, gave the convict an option of N5,000 fine and warned him to desist from committing crime. The convict, of no fixed address, had pleaded guilty to a count charge of making the atmosphere noxious to the public and begged for mercy. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Olarewaju Osho, told the court that the convict was arrested while smoking substance suspected to be Indian hemp, thereby making the environment noxious to public health. He said that part of the substance was recovered from the convict in the course of investigation. The offence, according to him, contravenes Section 192 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
