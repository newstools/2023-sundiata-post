Obi said that Nigeria today is not only disunited but is breeding poverty because of the bad leadership that has been foisted on the country over time.He recalled that, June 17, 1964, Belewa as Prime Minister applied for and got loan of $82m for the construction of the Kainji Dam, money he deployed judiciously and was expected to generate 760 megwats of power and the project is still there today 59 years after.“Today, we have borrowed over N77 trillion and can hardly account for it and this is responsible for the level of poverty all over the place, North and South,” he said. He pledged that if voted in he and Datti would build a new and great country of Belewa’s dream. “We will always remember Bauchi as the great city where a man who wanted to build a great Nigeria came from. It’s in fulfilment of his aspirations that I and Datti are seeking to build a great Nigeria, a secure and united Nigeria where the people will be educated and empowered.
