Enyimba International Football Club of Aba on Saturday in Jos beat hosts Nasarawa United FC of Lafia 2-1 in a 2022/2023 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) fixture. The Group A Match Day 1 fixture saw the winners scoring their first goal in the 33rd minute through Elijah Akanidomo, after a shot from just outside the penalty area. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the former African champions extended their lead four minutes later through Imo Obot who converted a free-kick into a goal. Josiah Oche scored with four minutes to go to reduce the tally, but it was just not enough to give them a draw that could have earned them a point from the game. Enyimba on their part ran out winners to claim the game’s three points and join early leaders Bendel Insurance FC of Benin at the top of their group’s table. NAN reports that Bendel Insurance FC had beaten Akwa United on Sunday in Uyo in the competition’s opening game. Three other matches —- Plateau United versus Shooting Stars, Kwara United versus Gombe United, and Remo Stars versus El-Kanemi Warriors —- will be played on Sunday in Group A. Group B action had seen Rangers International FC of Enugu hosting Abia Warriors of Umuahia on Saturday, while four matches have been lined up for 24 hours later. These are: Bayelsa United versus Dakkada FC, Wikki Tourists versus Niger Tornadoes, Doma United versus Sunshine Stars, and Rivers United versus Lobi Stars.(NAN)
