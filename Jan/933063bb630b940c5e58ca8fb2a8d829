NAN reports that the Minister of Finance, Budget and Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, had on Jan. 4, said that the federal government would end fuel subsidy by June. NAN also reports that fuel subsidy gulped N2.565 trillion between January and August 2022. The minister noted that fuel subsidy, in addition to budget deficit, had been putting pressure on the nation’s economy. According to Nzwkwe, government needs to be proactive in addressing the subsidy problem and ensure that a strong regulatory framework is put in place to check the oil sector,” he said. He appealed to the federal government to make concerted efforts toward repairing the nation’s four refineries so as to be able to produce at optimal level. The ex-ANAN president said that the repair of the refineries and the expected take-off of Dangote Refinery would put an end to importation of petroleum products and improve the nation’s economy. (NAN)
