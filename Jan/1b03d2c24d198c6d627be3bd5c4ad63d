Lagos – A yet-to-be-identified policewoman has been praised for always ensuring pupils who pass the Sabo Yaba area of Lagos where she controls traffic, dress properly as they head to school. A LinkedIn user shared photos of the police officer straightening the uniform of a student who was crossing the road where she works. “Everytime I pass by Sabo, Yaba, I can’t help but notice this Policewoman who would always make corrections on students who aren’t neatly and properly dressed. Many times she goes as far as dressing them up as seen in these pictures.” The photos have caused many Nigerians to commend her for contributing her quota to the growth and development of young Nigerians.
