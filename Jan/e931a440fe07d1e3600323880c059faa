The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), on Saturday took its sensitisation on the redesigned Naira notes to the Lafia Modern market and the palace of the Emir of Lafia in Nasarawa State. The apex bankâ€™s team led by the Director, Security Services, Alh. Atiku Muhammed-Nasir, said the visit to the palace was to pay homage to the Emir and for him help encourage his subjects to embrace the new banknotes. Muhammed-Nasir explained that the redesigning of the N200, N500 and N1,000 denominations was meant to address insecurity, inflation, counterfeiting among other benefits.
