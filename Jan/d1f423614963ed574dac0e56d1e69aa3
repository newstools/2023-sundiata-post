ABUJA – Presidential candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi, has explained that Next International (UK) Ltd was voluntarily dissolved as a business entity.  “In order that the huge human and material resources deployed to search and locate any negative against the high flying Labour Party Presidential Candidate, Peter Obi is not seen to have been wasted, anything could be concocted to justify the efforts. “We have watched with bemused skepticism as agents of the political opposition unsettled by the high rising profile of the Labour Party flag bearer, ran around and made fools of themselves over the Next International (UK) Limited being removed from the record in 2021. “Ordinarily, this is the type of mischief and impishness that should deserve no response but for the credulous in our midst who are the real target by this impairment. “The LP candidate by his antecedents in Anambra state for eight years, in private ventures where he heldsway his records among the pack in this race for the Presidency, puts him miles ahead in moral rating.”
