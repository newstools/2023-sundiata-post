Makurdi, – A Makurdi High Court on Thursday sentenced two young men, Jude Peke and Barnabas Apav, to 10 years imprisonment each for robbing commuters  on a highway. Justice Samson Itodo imposed the sentence after convicting the duo. The convicts and one Depuun Mbabeen, who lives at Udei Village in Guma Local Government Area of Benue, were charged with criminal conspiracy and armed robbery. The court, however, discharged and acquitted Mbabeen for lack of evidence. In the case filed by a Principal State Counsel, Mr Emmanuel Kpojim,  the convicts, on Feb. 27, 2018, attacked and robbed commuters at gunpoint at Udei Village on the Makurdi-Lafia Road. Their victims include a Makurdi-based lawyer, Mr Fidelis Mnyim, and  one Mr James Terngu, who were robbed of money  and  other belongings. Prosecution called four witnesses, including two victims and the investigating police officer, while the convicts testified for  defence. The trial judge held that the convicts lied to the court. He advised youths to engage in useful and honest ventures and avoid  crimes. He expressed dissatisfaction that armed robbery on highways had been rampant in Benue,  causing fear and terror. After the plea for mercy by counsel to the convicts, Mr C.T. Asoo, the judge  said that the court would temper justice with mercy considering  that the convicts were young and were first offenders. He ordered that the sentences should start from 2018 when the convicts  were arrested by the police. He noted that they had  been on remand since then. (NAN)
