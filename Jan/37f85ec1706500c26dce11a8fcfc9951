By Florence Onuegbu Lagos, – Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Sunday,  reiterated government’s commitment to giving needed support to members of the Armed Forces, both serving, retired, and families of fallen heroes. Sanwo-Olu stated this at an Interdenominational Divine Service held at the Chapel of Christ The Light, Alausa, to commemorate the 2023 Armed Forces Remembrance Day. The governor, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Mr Tayo Ayinde, pleaded with Nigerians and residents of the state to continue to offer prayers for the repose of the souls of the fallen heroes and the family members left behind. He also craved for support for the members of the Legion and relatives of deceased military personnel. According to him, no compensation in kind or cash can erase the pains of the death of the deceased gallant military officers. He said the annual commemoration of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day was a testament of the unwavering support to the security personnel, among other welfare support to the officers. The Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mr Anofiu Elegushi said the state government and Nigeria as a whole owed members of the Armed Forces invaluable gratitude. “This is for their selfless services to ensure  protection and security of the country from any internal or external threat.” Elegushi commended corporate organisations, especially private firms that had embraced the call to lend hand of support to the families of the fallen heroes. Earlier,  at the Interdenominational Service, Venerable Francis Falako, who is a priest from the Lagos Mainland Anglican Diocese,  urged Nigerians to forget the unpleasant situations of the past. Falako said that God had already promised to do a new thing for Nigerians in the new year. He urged residents to be prepared to complement efforts of the state government, so as to continue to deliver on its promises of implementing more developmental projects. (NAN)
