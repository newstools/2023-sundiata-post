By MUHAMMAD BELLO SOKOTO- Sen. Aliyu Wamakko (APC-Sokoto North), has urged the All Progressives Congress (APC) supporters in Sokoto State to go and collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). Wamakko, the APC leader in the state, made the call on Thursday shortly after returning to Sokoto from an official engagement outside the state. The lawmaker, who was received by scores of APC supporters in the state said: “All those who are eligible to vote should ensure their PVCs are intact ahead of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC deadline. “We need to know that one can only vote for the APC candidates if he or she has a PVC, otherwise, your support to the party is doubtful. “Therefore, as we love to see the success of all APC candidates, we need to ensure our PVCs are ready to justify our desired leadership,” he said. Wamakko further urged APC leaders in the state to intensity enlightenments on the need for the people of the state to get their PVCs at hand. He appreciated the people of the state for their foresight in supporting the APC and their sustained acceptance of the good leadership style of President Muhammad Buhari. (NAN)
