By Aisha Gambo Kaduna – A businessman, Musa Usman on Wednesday prayed a Sharia Court in Kaduna to order his divorce-seeking wife, Aisha Umar to pay him N320,000 in exchange for her freedom.Usman, through his counsel, Safiyanu Saleh said though he still loves his wife, he will not stop her from exercising her rights for divorce through Khul’i (redemption).“I paid N70,000 dowry but I want her to add N250,000 so that I will be able to marry another wife”, he said.Earlier, the complainant through her counsel, Abubakar Sulaiman prayed the court to dissolve her union with Usman through Khul’i.He said that she was no longer interested in the marriage and was ready to return the N70,000 dowry she received from him or less.“According to Islamic law, a woman can redeem herself from a marriage by paying back the dowry she received,  less or more; therefore we are praying to pay less due to the harsh economic situation.“Alternatively, we pray she spends her waiting period which is three monthly cycle in replacement of the N70,000”, he said.The Judge, Malam Rilwanu Kyaudai adjourned the matter until Jan. 24 for final address of the two parties as well as ruling.The News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) reports that waiting period known as Iddah is a period a woman must observe after the death of her husband or after a divorce, during which she may not marry another man.(NAN)
