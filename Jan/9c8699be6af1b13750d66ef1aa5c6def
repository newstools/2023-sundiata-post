The Forum of former Special Advisers (SAs) in Sokoto State has restated its loyalty to Sen. Aliyu Wamakko (APC-Sokoto North) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Alhaji Abdullahi Ahmad, the forum’s Chairman stated its decision at a news briefing on Sunday in Sokoto. According to Ahmad, the news brieifng was necessitated by stand of 13 out of over 180 members of the forum claiming to represent the majority in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “It is therefore instructive to note that no less than 93 per cent of the forum’s members are still united and solidly behind the APC under the leadership of Sen. Wamakko. “We have been and shall continue to support the APC following the PDP-led government’s failure to meet the yearnings and aspirations of the good people of Sokoto State in all areas of human endeavor,” he said. The chairman alleged that the state government had for the past seven years of its administration continued to cripple local government councils in the state. “Our business communities are totally neglected throughout this period and security of lives and properties has not received the attention it deserves. “This has continued to drive our state to be at the top of the national table in poverty and hunger. “It is in view of these challenges, numerous to mention, that we wish to align ourselves with the APC, its leaders and candidates to pilot the state come May 29, 2023,” he added. Ahmad appreciated the APC leaders in the state for their teamwork in holding the party together, while calling on supporters to resist all forms of pressure, threat and intimidation to vote all the party’s candidates.
