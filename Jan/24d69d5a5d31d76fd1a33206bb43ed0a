By IBRAHIM KADO YOLA- The National Orientation Agency (NOA) has begun sensitisation of Adamawa residents on the redesigned Naira notes. The Director of the Agency in the state, Bashir Gabdo stated this on Wednesday at a rally to create awareness on the new bank notes and the Jan. 31 deadline. He urged the people to take advantage of the remaining days to deposit the old Naira notes in banks before the dateline. “You should deposit the N1,000, N500 and N200 banknotes in your possession before the dateline of Jan. 31, so that you will not ignorantly keep expired currency in your possession. “The newly designed banknotes will be the country’s legal tender after the dateline,” he said. According to him, the new banknotes will help check counterfeiting, strengthen the economy, reduce expenditure on cash management and promote financial inclusion, among others. Gabdo also advised Nigerians to monitor the features of the new Naira notes to guard against counterfeiting, adding that the new banknotes are available in banks and other registered financial institutions across the country. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the campaign started from Police roundabout to Jimeta modern market up to vegetable market down to Mubi roundabout and Jimeta shopping complex. (NAN)
