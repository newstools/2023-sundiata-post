By CHIJIOKE KINGSLEY Abuja (Sundiata Post) – A businessman and an ex-governorship aspirant in Plateau State, Mr. Kefas Wungak Ropshik, popularly known as Kefiano, has said his whole life is dedicated to serving the needy who live in the society. Ropshik who is currently paying the school fees of some select blind men and women studying at the University of Jos, said it gladdens his heart to put smiles on the face of the less privileged. Kefiano who also donated N300,000 to support the hand craft enterprise of the blind who presented a craft they made to him as a birthday present, said he will continue to pay their school fees until they graduate from the University. Choosing to celebrate his birthday with over 400 widows and orphans in Jos on Monday, Ropshik said the gesture is his yearly ritual which he has been doing for over 13 years. “I have been doing this for over 13 years now. I am not doing this because I am the richest man on the Plateau but because I am passionate about the needy. “Like you all know, last year was very challenging to all of us, and it has cost me a lot to gather these widows and orphans here. But I have to do this to touch lives and put smiles on their faces. “My mantra has always been, what will I be remembered for when I die?I want to be remembered for the number of lives I have touched”, Ropshik said. He continued: “I am also doing this openly to encourage the people God has blessed to also reach out to the needy”, he said. He said as a follow-up to his birthday celebration, he will also be organising free medical services in the three geopolitical zones in Plateau. The occasion was graced by a notable billionaire businessman in the State, Amb. Nelson Uba Mpkaru, Chief Executive Officer, NELMACO Global Resources, who donated a whopping sum to support the Kefiano foundation. Our correspondent reports that over 500 bags of rice were distributed to the widows and orphans.
