The Civil Rights Realisation and Advancement Network (CRRAN) has called for an upward review of the yearly budgetary allocation to the military.The President of the non-governmental organisation, Mr Olu Omotayo, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Sunday.Omotayo spoke on the significance of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day celebration.He charged the Federal Government to go beyond the purchase of weapons to providing for the welfare of military personnel.He further appealed to Nigerians and government at all levels to support the military in its fight against insecurity in the country.Omotayo said that the military remained the only institution that “is keeping the nation together in the face of insecurity all over the country”.He said: “Government should make sure that it encourages the military, while the citizens should also offer necessary support.“In the past two years, if not for the efforts of the military, the situation would have been worse than what we have now.”The rights activist further urged the government to take care of the families of the fallen heroes and not neglect their welfare.“Government should make sure it settles the families of the slain soldiers with all their statutory entitlements.“The civilian populace should give the relevant information to the military operatives to help them win the war against insurgency and banditry across the country,” Omotayo said.
