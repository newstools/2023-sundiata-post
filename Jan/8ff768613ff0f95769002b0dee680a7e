By MUHYIDEEN JIMOH PARIS- Noel Le Graet, President of French Football Federation (FFF), has been suspended from his duties, the media reported on Wednesday, citing unnamed sources. The reports stated that an urgent meeting of the FFF executive committee named Vice-Chairman Philippe Diallo as acting interim Chairman. The 81-year-old Le Graet has been in the firing line over allegations of sexual harassment which he denies and criticism of French football icon and 1998 World Cup winner Zinedine Zidane.
