Media personality, Yeni Kuti, has opined that cheating is not a deal breaker in a relationship or marriage. Speaking on TVC, the 61-year-old daughter of Afrobeat legend, late Fela Anikulapo Kuti, said the only deal breaker for her will be if her man cheats on her with a fellow man.. however if he cheats with a female, she can allow it slide. ”For me cheating is not a deal breaker. My father had 27 wives, my mother didn’t go. I am not saying she was happy, but she didn’t leave. My own deal breaker is if I find out my own partner is sleeping with another man. That is my deal breaker. I will run, they wouldn’t even beg me. I will run” Watch the video below.. A post shared by Lindaikejiblog (@lindaikejiblogofficial)
