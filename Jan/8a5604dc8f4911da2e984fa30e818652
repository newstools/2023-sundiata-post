We need good representation at places that matter, where decisions are being made. This is one of the reasons I want to represent Ibadan North Federal Constituency,” he said. The aspiring lawmaker pledged to bring home jobs, investments and empowerment programmes that would put Ibadan North on the global news and map, through his connections.
