By Zainab Oyekan Jos, – An Area Court in Jos on Tuesday sentenced a 19-year-old trader James Bisat, to 18 months in prison for stealing diesel from a truck. The Magistrate, David Damulak sentenced Bisat after he pleaded guilty to the offence of conspiracy and stealing. Damulak, who sentenced the convict to one year in prison for stealing and six months for conspiracy, said the sentences would run concurrently. The Magistrate, however, gave the convict an option of N50,000 fine in the alternative. The magistrate said the judgment would serve as deterrent to those who would want to indulge in such a criminal act. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Monday Dabit told the court that the case was reported on Oct.14, 2022 at the “B” Division Police Station, Jos by one Joshua Kepkyes, a member of Hunter Group of Nigeria. The prosecutor said that the convict and his friends, now at large, were caught stealing diesel from a parked truck. Dabit said the offence contravened the provisions of Section 59 land 57 of Plateau Penal Code. (NAN)
