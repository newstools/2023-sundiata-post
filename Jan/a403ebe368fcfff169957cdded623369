By Idris Olukoya Epe (Lagos State), – Rep. Wale Raji (APC-Lagos) has told opposition parties in the country to showcase their achievements while campaigning. Raji made the call while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Epe  on Wednesday. He said that the electorate would be better informed if parties showed what they achieved while serving the people. The lawmaker, who is seeking a third term in the National Assembly, said it was improper to indulge in blackmail and blasphemy during campaigns. ”We must stop misleading the public with blasphemy, blackmail and character assassination. ”Campaign of calumny cannot take us anywhere. Let our achievements and antecedents speak for us,” he said. Raji said that as a lawmaker, he had constructed and rehabilitated no fewer than 15 roads across his constituency in the last five years. He also listed ICT centres, solar energy powered lights, women empowerment and cash grants to traders as some of his efforts to support his constituents. Raji said he would evolve more people-oriented programmes in the service of his constituency if given another opportunity. He promised to implement more youth and women empowerment programmes, infrastructure development and business support initiatives, if elected. ”I urge my people of Epe federal constituency to collect their voter cards and get prepared to exercise their franchise,” he said.(NAN)
