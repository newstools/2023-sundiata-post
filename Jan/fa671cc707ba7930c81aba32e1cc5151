By UMMUL IDRIS DHAKA- Bangladesh’s presidential election will be held on February 19, Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal said on Wednesday. Applications will be accepted until February 12, nomination papers will be reviewed on February 13, and the candidates will be able to withdraw until February 14, Awal said. On February 19, the lawmakers of the 350-strong parliament are then due to select the country’s next president, mostly a ceremonial position, from among the candidates, if more than one. If there is only one candidate on the ballot, the person will be elected unopposed. It is almost certain that the ruling Awami League’s nominee will serve for the next five years since it has an absolute parliamentary majority. The current president, Abdul Hamid, was first elected in April 2013, replacing Zillur Rahman, who died of respiratory complications at the age of 84. Hamid was re-elected in 2018. His term in office ends in April. He is constitutionally barred from serving for a third term.  (dpa/NAN)
