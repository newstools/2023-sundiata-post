Niger State – A family in Gbako LGA of Niger State has asked a suitor to take back the old N1,000 and N500 notes he gave as bride price. Daily Trust reported that the family of the suitor took an undisclosed amount to the family of the woman as bride price and money for other stuff in preparation for the wedding. While wedding was not postponed, guardians of the girl stated that they are not yet ready to buy some things needed for the ceremony and that they did not have a bank account to deposit the money, hence their demand for the new notes. They added that they made the demand because of the CBN deadline of January 31. A family member of the suitor said; We took money to the family of the girl we want to marry. They called me on Sunday to come and take the old currency notes back pending when we have the new naira notes. They said they don’t have anywhere to change the old notes. So, I want to take it to the bank pending when we get the new notes.” Reports that some bandits have attacked over 10 communities in Niger State, killed eight persons, abducted a bride and left several others injured.
