By SAM JONES YENAGOA (Sundiata Post) – Bayelsa State now has an Acting Chief Judge, Justice Matilda Abrakasa Ayemieye following the retirement last week of erstwhile Chief Judge, Justice Kate Abiri. The state governor, Senator Douye Diri, on Monday swore in Justice Ayemieye in an acting capacity pending her confirmation by the Nigerian Judicial Council. Governor Diri charged her to maintain the existing cordial relationship between the executive and judicial arms of government in the state. He said Ayemieye was eminently qualified for the position and tasked her to carry her colleagues along in the scheme of things in order to move the state judiciary to greater heights. The governor also used the opportunity to call on other members of the judiciary to support her in order for her to succeed. His words: “The newly appointed Acting Chief Judge was the most senior of the judges and has been working harmoniously with her predecessor, who also worked harmoniously with the other arms of government. “So, beyond being a high court judge, you are now in government as the leader of the judicial arm. We expect that you will maintain the same harmonious relationship that this government has enjoyed with the judicial arm of government. “Having gone through your CV, you have the pedigree to lead the judiciary. So, I wish you well and urge you to carry your colleagues along without discrimination. I pray that going forward you will move the state judiciary to greater heights.”
