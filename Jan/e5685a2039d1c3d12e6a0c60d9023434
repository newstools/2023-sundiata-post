The 30-year-old had been on loan at the Turkish club but has decided to move to Old Trafford until the end of the season A deal was reached between the two clubs earlier this week, but there was uncertainty as to whether the payment would be made to through Weghorst’s parent club, Burnley. It has now been revealed that United will pay the compensation fee straight to Besiktas as they look to complete the transfer, according to The Athletic.
