Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Secretary of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), North-East zone, Dr Babayo Liman, alongside hundreds of supporters have dumped the party for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Gombe State. Liman, who is also a member of the Rabiu Kwankwaso Presidential Campaign Council, stated this at a press conference in Gombe on Saturday. The secretary said he resigned from the NNPP and joined the PDP to support its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. “We registered more than 3.6 million people in the North-East region under the NNPP, and Gombe is one of the state in my zone, hence the need for me to go round and inform my supporters that I defected to the PDP. “I am resigning my appointment as the North-East Zonal Secretary of the NNPP, as a member of the presidential campaign council of the NNPP and as Coordinator of the Kwankwasiya in the zone,” he said. Liman stated that the spokesperson of the NNPP in the zone, Ibrahim Tal, also resigned his appointment in favour of Atiku. “I want to inform the over 600,000 NNPP members in Gombe State to defect and obtain PDP membership card,” he added. He, therefore, urged Kwamkwaso to withdraw from the presidential race and support Atiku. “Atiku Abubakar has the capacity to salvage the country from its present hardship and dwindling economy following his track record in the past as the Vice President of Nigeria,” Liman added. He described the 16 years of PDP administration as a success in view of the tremendous achievements recorded in the country.
