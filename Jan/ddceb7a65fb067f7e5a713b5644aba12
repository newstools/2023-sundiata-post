By Emmanuel Antswen Makurdi, – The police in Benue on Thursday arraigned Atser Terfa for alleged illegal possession of firearms. Terfa is facing a three-count charge bordering on conspiracy and membership of unlawful society, before a Makurdi Chief Magistrates’ Court. The Prosecutor, Insp. Kwegh Abugh, told the court that the case was transferred from “A” Divisional Police Station Makurdi to DZ Section State CID through letter in Dec. 12, 2022. Abugh said a team of Benue State Community Volunteer Guards led by Mr Yusuf Isa arrested the defendant on a tip off that he and his accomplices were planning to unleash mayhem on unsuspecting members of the public. He said that the defendant was arrested in Iniongun area of Makurdi, while his accomplices fled from the scene. Abugh said that one double barrel gun was recovered from the defendant. He said during police investigation the accused confessed to be a member of Vikings confraternity terrorising Makurdi town and environs. Abugh said that the offences contravened Sections 6(b), 3(1) of the Robbery and Firearms Special Provisions Act 2004, Sections 11 (2) and 4(2) of the Abduction, Hostage Taking Kidnapping, Secret Cult and Similar Activities Prohibition Law of Benue State 2017. He urged the court to adjourn the case to enable him conclude the investigation. The plea of the defendant was, however, not taken for lack of jurisdiction. The Magistrate, Mrs Kadoom Gbasha, remanded the defendant at the Federal Maximum Correctional Centre Makurdi and adjourned the case until Feb. 23 for mention. (NAN)
