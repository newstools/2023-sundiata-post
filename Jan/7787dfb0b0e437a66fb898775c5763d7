EHIGIMETOR IGBAUGBA CALABAR- Sen. Jarigbe Agom-Jarigbe says he would remain focused on campaign issues and how to continually impact positively on members of his senatorial district rather than exchange of words with Gov Ben Ayade of Cross River. Agom-Jarigbe, who represents Cross River North Senatorial District and aspiring for reelection, stated this in a statement made available to newsmen in Calabar on Thursday. The senator was reacting to a statement allegedly credited to Ayade during the APC rally in Ogoja that the 10th Senate was not “a place for somebody who will be sweeping the floor at the Red Chambers”. Ayade, who is the APC candidate for the senatorial seat, is seeking re-election, after representing the district between 2011 and 2015. In a veiled reference to a candidate, Ayade had said no stone should be left unturned in sending him to the Senate, in place of “somebody who will be sweeping the floor at the Red Chambers”. However, the incubent Senator said he would not condescend to the level of joining issues with those who had an “insatiable appetite” for mundane issues. In addition, he advised the opponents “to stay humble and allow their projects, if any, to talk rather than inundating us with their latest semantics”. He implored the governor to desist from  actions capable of undermining the dignity of his office and the harmonious co-existence among the people because of political ambition. Senator Jarigbe said he would continue to seek for the office through various projects he initiated that cut across the 54 wards of the senatetorial district. “All these projects were meant to address the peculiar needs of the various wards. “Basically, my message to the people is the pledge to continually do that which will uplift their standard of living and not exchanging banter with those whose interest is self enrichment,” he stated.(NAN)
