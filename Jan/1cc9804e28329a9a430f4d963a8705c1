Our uniforms now have security codes.”This, we believe, is part of measures to strengthen security in the state,” Ajewole said.He added that AbdulRazaq administration’s huge investment in road infrastructure is also to “our advantage” as it eases movement across the state.”We, therefore, believe that our state is in safe hands under his administration. ”Hence, we do not have cause to reject the administration or do anything that will bring disrepute to the people’s government,” declared the ORAN leader.
