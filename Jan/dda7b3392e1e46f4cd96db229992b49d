…As Senator Abbo describes development as a cash-and-carry judgement Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Justice Danladi Mohammed has barred Ishaku Abbo from contesting in the forthcoming Senatorial elections. The All Progressives Congress (APC) has also been restrained from recognising the politician as its candidate for Adamawa North in the forthcoming general election by the State High Court 3. Justice Danladi Mohammed ruled that Senator Abbo is not entitled to seek re-election since he has been expelled by the party. The Judge who also restrained Sen. Abbo from parading himself as the candidate of the party for the zone, also held that the embattled Senator and APC are bound by the resolution of Mubi North local government executives of the party dated, 7th October 2022, which expelled him and stops him from enjoying any right or privilege accorded to APC members. Senator Abbo however described the development as a cash-and-carry judgement. ⁸7⁷He told Channels Television that it is a ”bought-over” judgement because those who purportedly expelled him from the party are not local government party executives and therefore have no jurisdiction to do so. According to him, only the ward executives of the party, according to the APC constitution, have the right to punish any erring member and not the local government or even the state exco. Abbo who revealed that he will be filing an appeal against the judgement, further disclosed that the presiding judge had once issued a restraining order on the local government exco from parading themselves as exco.
