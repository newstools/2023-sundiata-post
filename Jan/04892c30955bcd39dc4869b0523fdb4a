By Olaitan IdrisLagos, – Two men, Wasiu Ajape, 30, and Quadri Raufu, 24, on Monday appeared before a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos, charged with armed robbery. The defendants, whose residential addresses were not provided, were charged with conspiracy, possession of dangerous weapons and armed robbery. The Prosecutor, Insp Magaji Haruna, told the court that the defendants allegedly committed the offences on Dec. 7, 2022, at Ojota/Ketu Bridge in Lagos. Haruna said that the defendants while armed with a short cutlass and broken bottles attempted to rob the complainant, one Wasiu Owolabi, of his valuables. He explained that the complainant, a towing truck driver, was about to tow a vehicle that broke down on the bridge when the defendant and their accomplices accosted him. The prosecutor said that prompt response of a patrol team of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS), the police security unit of Lagos State, saved what could have ended in misfortune for the driver. Haruna said that the defendants were arrested, while their accomplices escaped, taking to their heels. The offences, the prosecutor said, contravened the provisions of Sections 297, 330 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 297 prescribes 21 years jail term for armed robbery. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against them. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Linda Balogun, admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N200,000 each, with two responsible sureties each in like sum. Balogun adjourned the case until Feb. 14 for mention. (NAN)
