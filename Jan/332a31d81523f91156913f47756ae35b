The Liberia National Police have arrested 16-year-old Cyrus Logan, in connection with the gruesome murder of a 32-year-old alleged sex worker, Alpha Gray, also known as Abi. Some accounts state that Abi was a known sex worker who was involved in stealing from her clients, while other accounts state that she was a family person with three children – two boys and a girl. According to family members, the youngest of Abi’s three children is a girl and is a little over two years old. With support from the Liberian National Police, the remains of Alpha Gray were taken to the Johns F. Kennedy (JFK) Memorial hospital for further examination. They could not confirm whether body parts were extracted from her. They are, however, optimistic that the results from the JFK will give them a clear understanding of what transpired that led to her gruesome murder. The remains of the victim were buried on Saturday, January 7, 2023 at the GSA road Zinnah Community cemetery. Her family members are concerned about the mystery surrounding the death of their daughter and are calling for justice.
