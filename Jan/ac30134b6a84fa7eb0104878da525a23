If you are a husband or wife snatcher, you are an antichrist. If you are sleeping with an underaged, you are an antichrist. If you you are a landgrabber, you are an antichrist.  If you are sleeping with persons of the same gender or in the same sex marriage, you are an antichrist. If you are a politician and you have no intentions to redeem your promises, you are an antichrist.  And if you are a Nigerian and you have been complaining that Nigeria is a mess and you have not gotten your PVC to vote in the comming election, you are an antichrist” she said Watch her video below… A post shared by Lindaikejiblog (@lindaikejiblogofficial)
