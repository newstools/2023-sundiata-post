By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – A couple – Kehinde Fatinoye and Bukola – has been killed in a mysterious fire incident shortly after returning from a New Year/Crossover service in Abeokuta, Ogun State. A suspect has been arrested in connection with the death of the duo who reside in the Ibara Government Reservation Area of the capital, the Ogun State Police Command spokesman Abimbola Oyeyemi told Channels Television. The suspected arsonists are believed to have trailed the couple to their private residence before setting the home ablaze.
