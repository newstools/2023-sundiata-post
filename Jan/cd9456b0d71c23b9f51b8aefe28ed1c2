By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, on Saturday, said if the people of Kogi vote for him in the February 2023 presidential poll, the Ajaokuta Steel Complex and other challenges of the people would be solved. Atiku made the pledge while addressing supporters at the Kogi Confluence Stadium, the venue of the PDP presidential campaign rally in Lokoja. The PDP presidential candidate, who was accompanied by his running mate, Ifeanyi Okowa and other party stalwarts in the state, described Kogi as a PDP state. Atiku said, “I understand the All Progressives Congress came and deceived you in 2015 for your votes only to be put in terrible situations. But I’m assuring you that if you vote for me and PDP, you won’t regret it. “If you vote for me this time, the comatose Ajaokuta Steel Complex and other challenges of yours will be things of the past. “I want to assure you that there will be no more salary arrears and will give jobs and businesses, to do away with idleness and suffering. “Spending months without anything after university graduation will be a thing of the past as we intend to invest $10 million to launch young men into enterprises/businesses.” Earlier, the state Chairman of the PDP Presidential Campaign Committee, Ibrahim Wada, received scores of returnees led by the former deputy Governor to Yahaya Bello, Simon Asuba, back to the party. Asuba, however, told the crowd that he and other returnees had to leave the ruling APC because it failed to fulfil its promises to the Kogi people. “Today Kogi is faced with many challenges, which include salary arrears, poverty, insecurity and unemployment amongst others. “We want Nigeria to be rescued and moving forward again for the good of all Nigerians,” he said.
