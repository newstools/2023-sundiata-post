Abuja (Sundiata Post) – There was wild jubilation at the Adoration Ministry Enugu on Wednesday as the Spiritual Director, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, returned to the state. Following his suspension by the Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev. Callistus Onaga, the fiery priest had proceeded to the monastery. The diocese also shut down the Adoration Ministry over eight months ago and on June 3, 2022, the Bishop Onaga banned Mbaka from commenting on political issues. Shortly after the initial ban was lifted, Mbaka violated the political neutrality and attacked the presidential candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi, describing him as a “stingy man.” Last October, the diocese transferred Mbaka from the chaplaincy to the monastery and named Rev. Fr. Anthony Amadi to replace him (Mbaka) as the new chaplain of the Adoration Ministry Chaplaincy. The Bishop also advised Catholic faithfuls to pray for Mbaka.(Channels).
