The Customs Area Controller (CAC), Tincan Island Port Command, Comptroller Olakunle Oloyede, disclosed this at a news conference on Friday in Lagos. Oloyede said the figure represented an increase of N80.90 billion or 16.39 per cent when compared with N493.4 billion recorded in 2021. “This feat can be attributed to the constant rejiging of the existing measures geared toward sustaining the command’s revenue profile. “It is as well as utilisation of some disruptive strategic measures such as: periodic capacity building, reshuffling and redeployment of officers using the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis and implementation of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) valuation,” he said. He noted that the command also ensured robust and continuous stakeholder engagements and collaborations with all sister government agencies and maritime associations. “These led to timely intelligence sharing, utilisation and voluntary compliance to government’s extant laws by the trading public,” Oloyede said. He added that the command increased surveillance on declarations made in order to sniff out improper declarations as well as offending items. He pointed out that the system paid off with the command recording a total of 38 seizures with a Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N1.85 billion. “These seizures comprise of 763kgs of Colarado (Cannabis Sativa) weighing 345.1kg with a street market value of N714.6 million only as given by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), 5 x 40 containers of used motor tyre (5,060 pieces). “Also among seized items are: 1,150 bales of second hand clothings, 1,190 cartons of 20 per cartons of potassuem bromate and baking powder, 11,392 cartons of 1,200 per carton armcol injection chloroquine phosphate 322.5mg.5ml (IV and IM), 206,000 pieces of finished matchets. “Also, 1,383 cartons of 50 rolls per carton of cigarettes, 650 cartons of 50 pieces per carton of new ladies shoes, 2,666 pieces in 36 pallets of new starter Ex-Premium Inverter Battery, 1,980 cartons of assorted non-alcoholic beverages and 1,048 cartons of tilda basmatic rice,” he said. Oloyede listed others as 2,594 pieces of ammunition and 20 pieces of arms comprising of one pistol with 611090 (S/W) model JCP 40mm, one used Co2 air pistol with accessories cal 117(4.5m)BM, one marksman repeater pistol, six Mace pepper gun and 10 suspected arms of various types. He said that the seizures when compared with the 2021 record of 27 seizures with a Debit Note of N607.27 only, shows an increase of 11 seizures and N1.24 billion. He said that the increase in the DPV rate could be associated with increased surveillance and intensified anti-smuggling drive, high value of seized items and Naira depreciation that led to highe exchange rate on imported items. “These prohibited items were seized and forfeited to the Federal Government in line with the provision of Sections 46 and 161 of the Customs & Excise Management Act (CEMA) Cap 45 LFN 2004 and Absolute Prohibition List of CET 2022- 2026. “The command pertinently acknowledges the prominent roles played by the Customs Intelligence Unit, Valuation Unit, Federal Operations Unit, CGC Strike Force as well as interventions of Sister Regulatory Agencies like the NDLEA, Standards Organisationof Nigeria SON, the Nigeria Police and others in ensuring these seizures and detentions were made. “A total of 60 suspects were detained in 2022 and were granted administrative bail while the command has 8 cases pending in court,” he said. Oloyede said the command recorded significant increase in the Free On Board (FOB) of exports in the period under review to the tune of $589,696,648 (N242,365,322,333.00) as against the $496,075,796 (N141,985,109,159.00) recorded in 2021. He attributed the increase  of 34.4 per cent on the FOB to high quality and value of exported commodities. “However, the export report shows a decrease in tonnage of export from 1,723,986.8 in 2021 to 336,179.5 in 2022. “The decrease in tonnage could be connected to current government fiscal policy which prohibited the export of wood and wood products as well as the global unrests with its concomitant economic challenges,” he said He listed the commodities exported through the command to include: cocoa beans, insecticides, dried ginger, empty bottles, soya beans, cashew nuts, cigarettes, rubbers, cocoa butter, frozen shrimps, copper ingots, aluminium ingots, sesame seeds and other manufactured items. “Cocoa beans was the highest exported commodity while the legend stout was the least exported commodity. “The future of export in the command looks brighter as the command in line with the headquarter circular on Export Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) released a Port Order on the Command’s harmonised SOP for the seamless facilitation of Export Trade in strict compliance with Extant Laws and guidelines on Export,” he said. He thanked all stakeholders and sister government agencies involved in the export chain with special commendation to the Nigeria Ports Authority for seamless collaboration in facilitating the clearance process of export-related cargo at the command.
