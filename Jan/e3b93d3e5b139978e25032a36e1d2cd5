South Africa – South Africa Police has arrested three suspects for allegedly aiding a Nigerian national to gain entry into the country. Police spokesperson, Captain Lloyd Ramovha, in a statement, said the suspects Pedro Lewis (46) Tobi Oyesile (36), Stanley Mukhari (39) and Kenny Mahlangu (40) appeared in the Kempton Park Magistarte’s Court on Friday, January 6, 2023, for alleged violation of the Republic of South Africa immigration Act. “The group was arrested in the early hours of Thursday, 05 January 2023, at OR-Tambo International Airport (ORTIA). It follows the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation that was prompted by intelligence gathered by the South African State Security Agency (SSA),” Ramovha said. “The intervention uncovered that Pedro Lewis, an airport station manager, allocated as a representative for the expected Ivory Coast Airline flight, Swissport employees, Stanley Mukhari and Kenny Mahlangu colluded with Tobi Oyesile, a Nigerian National to afford him a safe path out of the airport corridors despite him not having valid papers. “The team was strategically in place just after midnight when the plane landed. Lewis also appears to have been the one who facilitated collecting Oyesile’s luggage using an unoccupied wheelchair. A further probe at the restricted area of the airport netted Oyesile and the two Swissport employees who were already prepared to exit. “The court has granted Lewis, Mukhari and Mahlangu R 2 000-00 bail each. Oyesile remains in custody, whilst the case was postponed to Friday, 13 January for his attempt at a bail application.”
