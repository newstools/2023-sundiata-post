She walked the streets of Lagos, A shadow of her former self, Her spirit broken, her soul scarred, Trapped in a life of poverty and unfurled wealth. Her childhood, a distant memory, A blur of days and nights, Of endless labour and forced servitude, And no chance for education or rights. But deep inside her, a spark still glimmered, Like a diamond in the rough, A dream of something better, A hope that refused to be snuffed. Like a caged bird, she sang her song, A symphony of longing and desire, A melody of the heart, A tune that set her soul on fire. With every step she took, She chiseled away at her chains, She rose like a phoenix from the ashes, Reborn and ready for the pains. She fought for her right to learn, For a chance to reach for the stars, And as she climbed the ladder of success, She left her past behind and its bars. She ventured into the unknown, With a compass of hope and a map of ambition, Through the storms and seas of life, She navigated with precision. A beacon of hope, a shining star, A woman in Nigeria, no longer broken and beaten, She’s a masterpiece of resilience, A work of art, unique and divinely written. Like a warrior, she stood her ground, With a sword of knowledge and shield of strength, And wrote her own story, With the ink of courage and a pen of hope, A tale of triumph, forever to be told in length. And now, as she stands tall and proud, A queen in her own right, She radiates a light that will never die out, A source of inspiration, that will shine bright.
