By Judith EzeudoguAbuja, – A 15-year-old on Monday, told a Customary Court in Jikwoyi, Abuja, that her uncle pours chicken droppings on her as punishment. Her aunt, Mrs Joy Omwegbu filed a divorce petition against her husband Justus. “My uncle also beats me like a thief, whenever I make small mistakes. “After beating me, he will gather chicken droppings and mix it with water and will pour it on me,” she told the court in tears. Testifying in favour of her aunt, she told the court that her uncle always picks up fight with her aunt. “On one occasion, my uncle picked up my aunt’s phone and removed her SIM card while she taking her bath and kept the phone in his possession, “When my auntie came out, she confronted him and he beat her up, calling her a prostitute. ”He pushed her out of the house with all her belongings and also destroyed the bag making materials my Aunty bought for her business,” she said. She also alleged that her uncle ceased her WAEC results. The presiding judge,  Malam Labaran Gusau, stopped the testimony and adjourned the matter until Feb. 9, for further hearing because the witness was crying uncontrollably.  (NAN)
