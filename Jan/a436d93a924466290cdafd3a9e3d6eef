In a bid to resolve the seeming crisis, the lawmakers had set up a committee to investigate these claims and seek ways to resolve them. On Wednesday, January 25, Emefiele was invited for questionning but he failed to appear before the house. Expressing his displeasure at the CBN governor for failing to appear before the committee, Gbajabiamila said he will not hesitate to ask the Inspector General of Police to arrest Emefiele.

He informed the house that the CBN had written to the Clerk, informing the House of Emefieleâ€™s inability to appear before the committee on Thursday, January 26. The Speaker said the House would exercise its powers as contained in Section 89 of the 1999 Constitution.
