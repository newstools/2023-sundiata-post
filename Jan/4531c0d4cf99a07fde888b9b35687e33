By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Department of State Services (DSS) on Tuesday said there are schemes by some politicians to smear its director-general, Yusuf Bichi, and some of the service’s key officials. In a statement, DSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya, said the politicians, as well as ‘disgruntled elements’ within and outside the government, are waging war against “the service’s uncompromising stance on some critical governance and policy issues”. Specifically, he accused the politicians of using civil society and non-governmental organisations to discredit Bichi. He asked Nigerians to “be wary of these tendencies and ignore the antics of dark forces out to impugn the character of the DG.” “Those behind the plot have engaged Civil Society and Non-Governmental Organisations to not only sustain but stage further rallies, road shows and press conferences and use the occasions to discredit Bichi,” the statement read. “Also, sections of the media have been briefed to implement the strategy through sponsored articles, commentaries and features to malign the DG, his family and select officials of the Service.” “The service is monitoring developments and will allow the plotters to either exhaust themselves or rescind the plan of action. Otherwise, no intimidation, harassment or blackmail will deter it from discharging its duties. “However, it would not idly watch a group of dissatisfied gangs undermine the service and its highly dedicated leadership and management. “The DSS, therefore, wishes to inform the public to be wary of these tendencies and ignore the antics of dark forces out to impugn the character of the DG.” According to Afunanya, the service would continue to confront threats to national security and is working to create a conducive atmosphere for the general election.
