By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Barr Aloy Ejimakor, the Counsel to the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has commended Anambra State Governor, Chukwuma Soludo for calling for his client’s release. Ejimakor commended the governor on Monday, days after Soludo urged President Muhammadu Buhari to release the IPOB leader. On Saturday, the governor offered to act as a surety for the IPOB leader who has been in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) since he was rearrested in June 2021. “I am making a passionate appeal to the Federal Government to release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu unconditionally. If he cannot be released unconditionally, I want him released to me and i will stand surety for him. “We need Nnamdi Kanu in the roundtable conversation to discuss the insecurity in the South-East. We must end insecurity in the South-East and we need Nnamdi Kanu to be around,” Soludo said. Taking to Twitter on Monday, Kanu’s lawyer thanked the governor for calling for his client’s release and offering to be his surety. Noting that he visited the IPOB leader on Monday, Ejimakor also disclosed that Kanu’s nutrition and medicals had been poor. “I just concluded a visitation with #MNK. He directed me to publicly convey his appreciation to Governor Chukwuma Soludo for the political courage he displayed by demanding his unconditional release. On a sad note, he told me that his nutrition & medicals remain erratic,” Ejimakor tweeted. UPDATE: I just concluded a visitation with #MNK. He directed me to publicly convey his appreciation to Gov.
