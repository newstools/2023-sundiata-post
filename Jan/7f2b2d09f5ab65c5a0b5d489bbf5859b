A group, Young Progressives in Oyo State (YPO), says Lanre Sarumi, the House of Representatives candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ibadan North, remains the best candidate for the Federal Constituency. President of the group, Wale Adeoye, said that Sarumi has “a comprehensive youth-focussed agenda that could liberate the younger generations”. Adeoye said, in a statement on Saturday in Ibadan, that Lanre Sarumi’s track record “is unprecedented and unmatched among the candidates vying for Ibadan North Federal Constituency”. According to him, Sarumi is a Software Technology Delivery Consultant, who hasconsulted for various sector organisations such as Insurance, Health sector, Government, non for profit organisations and more, supporting software implementation at multiple capacity. He said that his achievements outside office had been a reference point, not only in Ibadan North, but in Ibadan, the state capital as a whole. “He is building an ultra-modern toilet infrastructure in The Polytechnic, Ibadan and pioneered light up project in the inner parts of the city, an initiative his opponent, hurriedly replicated,” Adeoye said. He said that the candidate has embarked on different local empowerment programmes, including: medical outreach, employment of four ad hoc staff at Sabo Medical Centre, market women empowerment, bore-hole provision, disbursement of busaries to primary school pupils in Oke-Itunu, among others. “Sarumi’s style of leadership is an example of inclusive society. He is leading a legacy of contributing one’s quota to governance, even while you are not part of it yet. “This is the type of person we need to sustain leadership in Ibadan North. He is one man for all in Ibadan North. “Let other candidates in Ibadan North, tell us how many people have benefited from them politically,” Adeoye said. He said that Sarumi was born into the Akintayo Basiri-Sarumi Family of Abebi area of Ibadan.(NAN)
