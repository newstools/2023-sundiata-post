By Chijioke Kingsley Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Managing Director, Jos Electricity Distribution Company, Engr Abdu Bello Mohammed, has expressed his excitement over the surge in December 2022 revenue collection, totalling N3.3 billion. Mohammed said to ensure a continuous increase in revenue generation, the energy company will strive to boost electricity supply to its teeming customers. “We will sustain quality and sufficient energy delivery to the people of Bauchi, Benue, Gombe and Plateau States to serve as an elixir to the customers”, Mohammed said while briefing journalists in Jos recently. According to him: “The company has put in place a mechanism to expeditiously address faults. We also plan to establish workshops in the four states to prevent delays associated with the repairs of faulty transformers. We don’t want our customers to be out of supply for any reason”, he said. He emphasised however that for the company to achieve the above feat, customers should endeavour to live up to their responsibility of paying for their consumed energy. On the backlog of debt owned the company, the Jos DisCo boss decried that customers are hugely indebted to the company to the tune of over N100 billion, adding that to give soft landing to their debtors, he has introduced a debt discount promo of 30 per cent, due to elapse by end of January 2023.
