By DAVIDSON ABRAHAM, Midde East Erik Ten Hag insists Manchester United will not be “burning money” on bringing in the wrong striker this January. After a tough start to life as Red Devils manager, Ten Hag’s team have been much improved of late and currently sit fourth in the Premier League after three straight league victories, despite being short of options up front. Cristiano Ronaldo was in and out of the team before his bombshell interview with Piers Morgan led to his contract being mutually terminated, while Anthony Martial has struggled with injuries. But despite the need for a centre-forward to help United’s Champions League qualification bid, Ten Hag feels United must avoid the mistakes of the past by wasting finances on the wrong striker. “You need one who can have an impact otherwise you are just burning money,” Ten Hag told reporters. “You don’t strengthen the squad and it doesn’t help you. “We have a good team when all are available. We have [a striker], Anthony Martial, I am happy with his performances across many games. “He has had a really good impact. If you see his minutes and the impact he has had it’s been huge.” One suggestion for United to boost their attacking ranks has been to recall Amad Diallo, who has scored six goals in 19 matches on loan at Championship side Sunderland. But Ten Hag is reluctant to bring Diallo back to Old Trafford early, believing it would be wrong to stunt the progress the Ivory Coast international is making with the Black Cats. “We consider everything. I have a little reservation because I don’t want to stop the process, he is making good progress there,” Ten Hag added. “Young players need experiences. “When we decide [he needs] to come back he has to be a player who can compete for the starting 11 or at a minimum of coming on for a lot of games to have an impact.”
