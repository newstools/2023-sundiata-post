By Olaitan Idris Lagos, – Two security guards were on Tuesday brought before a Sabo-Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos, for allegedly conspiring to steal property worth N7 million from their employer.

The Prosecutor, ASP. Rita Momah, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on Dec. 31, 2022, at No 17, Philip Ojedokun, Magodo GRA, phase 1, Lagos.

The offences, Momah said, were punishable under Sections 287, 307, and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Adeola Olatubosun, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N1 million each, with two sureties each in like sum. She said that one of the sureties must be a land owner and show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government.‎ Olatubosun adjourned the case until Feb. 6, for substantive trial. (NAN)
