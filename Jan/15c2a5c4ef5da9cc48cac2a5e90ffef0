Imo State – A couple, Mba Ifeoma Gloria and Eremezie Tochukwu Martin, whose wedding was slated for January 18, 2023, have been killed by yet-to-be-identified gunmen at Arondizuogu in the Ideato North Local Government Area of Imo state. Residents of the community say the intending couple was taking a ride in the groom’s brother’s tricycle when they were attacked by the gunmen who killed all three of them on Wednesday, January 11. Troubled by the incessant killings and kidnappings in their community, members of the community came out en mass on Wednesday to lay curses on the assailants perpetrating the crime. They also claim that the assailants have invaded their community and specialize in stealing flashy cars and killing their owners. The state police command is yet to comment on this unfortunate incident. Watch video of the community members cursing the assailants below… A post shared by Lindaikejiblog (@lindaikejiblogofficial)
