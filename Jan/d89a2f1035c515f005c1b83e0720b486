By MARTHA AGAS JOS- Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau has lauded the support of residents and other stakeholders to the various peace-building initiatives in the state. The governor gave the commendation during a state broadcast to mark the new year celebrations on Sunday in Jos. “We also thank most specially the security agencies, traditional rulers, religious leaders, civil society organisations, community development associations, youth and women groups for their active roles in rescuing Plateau. “As we look toward more progress in the New Year, we should remain steadfast and continue to think and act Plateau because the common good is always superior to our individual interests. “That is the only way we can respond to threats against our collective aspirations and boost confidence in our state, “ he said. Lalong said that his administration was committed to ensure peace, security and harmony in the state, adding that the administration had substantially reversed the negative perception of Plateau as a place to avoid. He said that the relative stability  was encouraging people to invest, reside, hold conferences and visit the state for holidays. The governor noted that in the more than seven years of his administration, many organisations have held local and international conferences in Plateau. “During the years under review, Plateau played host to three International Conferences and Workshops, well over 18 local conferences, seminars and workshops as well as one International Golf Tournament,” he said. He pointed out that the collaborative efforts residents with security agencies and other stakeholders helped to expose criminals and crises merchants in the state, leading to the path for restoration of its fortunes. Lalong revealed that the United Nations has approved the establishment of a Peace University in Plateau to serve as a hub for teaching and research in peace-building and conflict management. (NAN)
