Moscow, – Moscow warned of a further deterioration in German-Russian relations if Berlin delivers Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine. “Such shipments do not bode well for the future of relations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday, according to the news agency Interfax. Moscow’s warning is coming on the heels of Poland’s request for permission from the German government to export its German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. In a Tweet on Tuesday, Poland’s defence minister asked Berlin to send the tanks as well. “I also appeal to the German side to join the coalition of countries supporting Ukraine with Leopard 2 tanks,” Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak wrote. “This is our common cause, because the security of the whole of Europe is at stake!” he wrote. According to information obtained by dpa, the Polish request had already been submitted to the German government on Tuesday. Poland has been putting increasing pressure on its allies to get the tanks to Ukraine. However, Berlin has not said it will do the same. Moscow had repeatedly criticised Western arms deliveries to Ukraine as an escalation in the war. (dpa/NAN)
