By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Some hoodlums have burnt down the Umuchu Police Station, along the Umuchu-Achina road in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State. It was gathered that the hoodlums invaded the police station in the early hours of Sunday setting the facility ablaze. Channels Television reports that the station was recently renovated through communal effort, more than two years after it was destroyed by some agitators during the #EndSARS protest. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Tochukwu Ikenga, confirmed the incident to Channels Television on Monday. According to Ikenga, there was no loss of life, neither were arms carted away in the arson. The police spokesman assured that normalcy has returned to the area, adding that discreet investigation is ongoing to track the perpetrators of the ugly act. He called on members of the public to always assist the police with useful information that will support the enhancement of security in the state, adding that the mantra of the state government on “Seeing something and saying something” should be promoted.
