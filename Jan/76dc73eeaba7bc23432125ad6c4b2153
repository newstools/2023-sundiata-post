Alaba-Olusola OkeAkure, – A Magistrates’ Court in Akure has docked one Hammed Idowu, a hair stylist in Badagry, Lagos, for allegedly converting N270,000 belonging to Mr Femi Panu to himself. The prosecutor, Insp. Taiwo Oniyere, told the court that the accused committed the offence on Jan. 8, in Akure at about 6:28 a.m. Oniyere  said that the accused was arrested at Seme Border. He said the complainant mistakenly transferred N270,000 into the account of the defendant instead of N30,000 and that all efforts to get the money back proved abortive. He asked that the court adjourn the case to enable him to study it more and bring his witnesses. The counsel to the defendant, Mr Tope Owoeye, said that the sum of N100,000 had already been refunded to the complainant. He asked the court to grant the defendant bail in the most liberal term, promising to ensure that the remaining money was paid back on time. Owoeye said that the offence was bailable and that the accused would not run away if granted bail. The Magistrate, Mr Olatunji Abu, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N100,000 with one surety that must be a resident of Akure with verified home address. Abu adjourned the case until Feb.10 for continuity.( NAN)
