Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Troops of Operation Forest Sanity have neutralised two bandits and cleared several of their hideouts in the Chikun Local Government Area (LGA) of Kaduna State. This was disclosed in a statement on Tuesday by the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan. He said the troops achieved the breakthrough during fighting patrols along the Kaboresha-Rijana Forest-Kuzo-Kujeni-Gwanto-Kachia axis. According to the Commissioner, the troops set up an ambush position along the Gwanto-Kwasau Road, and thereafter, engaged the bandits approaching the location on motorcycles. During the process, the troops killed the two bandits and recovered three motorcycles. The troops also raided bandits’ camps in the Kutura-Rijana general area during which the bandits fled into the forest on sighting the troops, who then destroyed the camps and recovered three motorcycles. Other items recovered include several sets of military uniforms and bandoliers. While assuring residents that the onslaught against bandits was in progress, Aruwan appealed to the general public to continue to volunteer useful information.(Channels)
