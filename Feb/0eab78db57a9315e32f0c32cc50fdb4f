German-born Nigerian footballer, Karim Adeyemi, says the secret behind his unusual speed on the field is African dish, fufu. The winger, who is rated as the fastest man in Bundesliga, demonstrated his incredible speed during the UEFA Champions League match against Chelsea on Wednesday night, February 15. Adeyemi ran past Chelsea player, Enzo Fernandez, to score a solo goal that gave the German side their win. Speaking to newsmen after the game, the 21-year-old star, who was born in Germany to a Nigerian father, attributed his speed to eating fufu. “I eat a lot of African foods but I have good genetics from my dad. [The food] is called Fufu from Nigeria,” he said in a post-match interview. “The only thing I was thinking [against Enzo Fernandez] was that I just need to get the ball past him. You just try to win your duels, the goalkeeper came out and there may have been a bit of luck, but I’m delighted with the goal.” It’s a case of new year, new luck. For me, it’s that simple. As a team, we talked a lot during the break and it brought us closer together. The win tonight was crucial and it was unbelievable to play in front of these fans. We wanted to give Chelsea a tough game from start to finish and we’ve won.”
