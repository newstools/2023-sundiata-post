By Chijioke Kingsley Abuja (Sundiata Post) – A group of election Observers have vowed to expose vote buying, under aged voters and over voting in the February 25th Presidential elections. The Observers led by the Intercontinental Leadership Initiative on Friday in Jos during a press conference said they are calling on all stakeholders to avoid all forms of electoral malpractices. Speaking while addressing newsmen, the lead trustee, Intercontinental Leadership Initiative, Mr. Prince Stafford Bisong, said Observers will not allow bad politicians to deprive the country of electing good and credible leaders. “We are calling on all stakeholders to avoid every form of electoral malpractices because our team of Observers are watching keenly to report accordingly”, Bisong said. According to him: “Our vote is precious, it is the most powerful nonviolence tool in our society today and we must use it. In the words of Pat Mitchell, If you don’t vote, you are ignoring history and giving away your future. “Bad leaders are elected by good citizens who do not vote because voting is the expression of our commitment to ourselves, one another, our country Nigeria and the world at large. “Nobody will deprive you of the right to vote except you deprive yourself by not voting”, he said. Bisong called on all Nigerians of voting age who have PVC to go out and exercise their franchise by voting for the candidate of their choice in tomorrow’s Presidential and National Assembly Elections. “We want all Nigerians to know that the security team led by the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba have assured us during the signing of the Peace According in Abuja of a safe and secure environment for voting”, Bisong assured.
