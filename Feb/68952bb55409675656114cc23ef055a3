Tonto Dikeh liked a post shared by her friend and colleague, Doris Ogala, slamming the actress’ ex-husband, Olakunle Churchill, for taking to social media to wish his first child, King Andre, a happy birthday. Churchill has not had access to his son since his union with Tonto crashed. This morning he took to his Instagram page to wish King Andre a happy birthday. Doris was displeased by his post and took to Instagram to slam him, calling a ??fool” and ??idiot”. She wrote ??BIA Churchill you are a fool .. in-fact you are an idiot.. why won?t you stay With that one that witch gave to u.. must u put mouth here .. attention seeker .. seehhh no body should come for me oooo .. I didn?t wake up well .. olodo na only birthday u will remember he?s your son.. abeg .. let the boy be please.. SCHOOL FEES NOW .. YOU WILL HIDE YOUR FACE.. BROKE ASS” In an apparent approval of the post, Tonto pressed the like button.
