ABUJA – Pa Ayo Adebanjo, leader of the pan-Yoruba socio-political group Afenifere, has explained why the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi must win the 2023 presidential election scheduled to hold on 25 February. Adebanjo, who has been a staunch supporter of Obi, said if the LP candidate loses there would be no opportunity for a non-Christian and a non-northerner to be president again. Adebanjo made his position known at the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum in Abuja. Adebanjo further stated that “if Obi does not win, forget a country called Nigeria.” He said, “They are making all sorts of devices to ensure that power remains in a particular part of the country. That’s why they are not even supporting the candidate of their own party. “We will give it what it takes. It is either bend or break. If Obi does not win, forget a country called Nigeria. “If we lose this election, there will be no opportunity for a non-Christian, a non-northerner to be president again,” he said. Adebanjo said voting for Obi would show that Nigeria values ethnic and religious inclusion. Adebanjo first declared support for Obi in July 2022 in an interview with an online radio. Adebanjo had said, “It is only Peter Obi that can rule independently without the influence of these criminals in the government. Tinubu will only give continuity to Buhari’s incompetence. “We know Peter Obi very well, that’s why we endorsed him. He will not disappoint Nigerians, let’s put tribal differences apart and vote the right leader in.” Speaking with The PUNCH in July Adebanjo had also said that, “Am I not the first to say that for equity and justice and for peace, it’s the South-East? I don’t know any other candidate from the South-East other than Obi and I have been very specific about Obi.” (The PUNCH)
