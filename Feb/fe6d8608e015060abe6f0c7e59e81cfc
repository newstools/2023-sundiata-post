The Judge, Saminu Suleiman, however, gave the convicts an option of N20,000 fine eachSulieman also ordered the convict to pay N50,000 as compensation to the owner of the tank. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Mr Chinedu Ogada, told the court that the complainant, Rabiu Bello of the same address, reported the matter at Dei-Dei  Police Station on Jan. 26 Ogada said that on the same date, the convicts criminally conspired and went into a compound in Shagari Quarters, Dei-Dei, belonging to one Halima Ibrahim of Gwarinpe.
