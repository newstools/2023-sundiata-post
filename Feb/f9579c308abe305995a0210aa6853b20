By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Labour Party Spokesperson in Ogbaru Federal Constituency, Anambra State, Chinedu Uwolloh, has raised the alarm over the inexplicable delay in announcing the result of the House of Representatives election in Ogbaru, Anambra State, which he said Labour was leading convincingly. Tension has been building in Ogbaru Local Government Area due to the delay in releasing the result of the recently held House of Representatives election, over 48 hours after the conclusion of the election. Records from the already collated results indicate that the Labour Party is currently leading the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), with over 1,500 votes. While the LP’s candidate is Hon. Victor Afam Ogene, former House of Representatives member, his closest rival so far is Hon. Arinzechukwu Awogu of APGA, while PDP which is currently trailing in third position is represented by Hon. Chukwuka Onyema, who is the incumbent representative for Ogbaru Federal Constituency in the National Assembly. Although there are reports of a few polling units where election didn’t hold, the Ogbaru electorate are worried that the genuine reflection of their will, which was displayed at the polls, may be compromised by some desperate powerful individuals who are bent on forcing their self interest on the people. The Labour Party has therefore called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to do the needful and protect the integrity of the election in Ogbaru, by making sure that the result is not compromised by undemocratic interests.
