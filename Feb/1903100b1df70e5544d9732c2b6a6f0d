On Monday February 20, 2023 I released statement on the subject matter: Theft, Pipeline Vandalism Responsible For Volumes Of Crude Lossesâ€”Sylva to the media for publication. The statement was a draft statement which should not have been released to the media for publication as it did not get the clearance of the Minister of State Chief Timipre Sylva. The statement was not in anyway released to denigrate the reputation of the head of any agency or government official or to dispute the figures released by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC). It was released in error. I apologise for any discomfort or inconveniences the statement may have caused by it release.
