By CECILIA ODEY ABUJA- There is tight security in and around the Abuja Municipal Area Council(AMAC) office of the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC) in Karu as collation of results continues. The News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) reports that no fewer than 30 Police officers and other security agents were stationed in the area to forestall break down of law and order. There is also restriction of movement in and around the INEC premises, while the road leading to the office was cordoned off. Meanwhile, the AMAC INEC Electoral Officer, Mr Yahaya Mustapha, told NAN that collation of the Feb. 25 Presidential and National Assembly elections was ongoing. He said that there were 12 wards under AMAC, seven of which had presented their results. Mustapha said results from the remaining five wards were still being expected, adding that the delay stemmed from a few hitches experienced in some wards. He said once the results were collated at the centre, which is the Local Government Collation Centre, the Presidential and Senatorial results will be transmitted to the State INEC office at Garki Area 10. He, however, said the result of House of Representatives for AMAC/Bwari Federal Constituency would be announced at the AMAC Collation Centre. NAN reports that the Federal Capital Territory(FCT) has two Federal Constituencies, AMAC/Bwari Federal Constituency and Kwali/Kuje/Gwagwalada Federal Constituency.(NAN)
