ABUJA (Sundiata Post) – Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has debunked the fake news posted on the verified Instagram and Twitter handles of the First Lady of Nigeria, Mrs Aisha Buhari. The fake news posted on the two social media handles of the First Lady on Tuesday morning purportedly indicated that the old N200, N500 and N1000 banknotes have been allowed to be recirculated as legal tender till May 1, 2023 contrary to the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari that only the old N200 banknote is allowed as legal tender till April 10, 2023. But, minutes later the CBN posted a real press statement it issued days ago and a counterfeited or distorted version of it posted by Mrs Buhari, which conveyed the fake news. The apex bank also issued a press statement signed by Edward L. Adamu, Deputy Governor, Corporate Services Osita Nwanisobi Director, Corporate Communications in which it described the purported press release on old notes as fake. The statement reads “The attention of the Central Bank of Nigeria has been drawn to a FAKE PRESS RELEASE “Purported to have emanated from the Bank to the effect that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the reissuance and release of old N500 and N1000 notes as legal tender in the country.“For the avoidance of doubt, the Central Bank of Nigeria reiterates that in line with the directives of Mr. President, only N200 old notes are to be reissued and to circulate concurrently with the new notes. Members of the public are therefore advised to ignore thisfake news.“The Bank is working with the law enforcement agencies to investigate, apprehend and prosecute the purveyors of this fake news. “Please be guided accordingly.” Edward L. Adamu Deputy Governor, Corporate Services Osita Nwanisobi Director, Corporate Communications February 21, 2023
