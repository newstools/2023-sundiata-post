ABUJA – The Director of Media and Publicity of the All Progressives Congress, Presidential Campaign Council, APC PCC, Bayo Onanuga, has described the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, as a “public enemy”. Mr Onanuga, who made the assertion in a tweet on Wednesday, said just like the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele, Mr Malami doesn’t have the interests of the masses at heart. He made the comment in reaction to a news report which quoted Mr Malami as filing a preliminary objection requesting the Supreme Court of Nigeria to dismiss the suit filed by three northern governors to stop the implementation of the CBN’s naira redesign policy. “Abubakar Malami is also a public enemy like Emefiele,” he tweeted. Recall that a seven-member panel of the apex court led by Justice John Okoro temporarily restrained the federal government from banning the use of the old naira notes from February 10. The court granted the relief in an ex parte application filed by Kaduna, Kogi, and Zamfara states. But the minister argued that the Supreme Court lacks the jurisdiction to hear the case.
