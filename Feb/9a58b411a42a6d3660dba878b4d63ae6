Ibadan â€“ Commercial activities were paralyzed in some parts of Ibadan, the capital city of Oyo state as residents staged a protest over the current scarcity of Naira notes this morning, February 15. The residents used cars and motorcycles to block some major roads in the city, causing traffic gridlock. They stated that the new notes have remained scarce and that the old N200, N500, and N1000 have now become illegal tenders, making it difficult to do business.
