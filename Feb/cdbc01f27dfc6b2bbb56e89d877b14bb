The Party’s Gubernatorial candidate, Dr IfeanyiChukwuma Odii, who welcomed the decampees in Abakaliki, said the PDP is ready to win in the forthcoming general elections. “PDP as a transformed party has brought lots of transformation to Ebonyi before the mandate was stolen away, but we are moving forward to reclaiming it. “I want to assure our people that by the special grace of God, we will attend to our manifesto. “When we come on board, we will make sure that every child in the state will have access to education. “We will create wealth for the people, suffering will erased and there will be jobs for the youths. “This movement today shows that PDP is one family and we will continue to unite for victory. Our party believes in peace and hopefully, the election will be peaceful. “You are welcome to the umbrella, where you belong today, which is capable of accommodating everyone in Ebonyi and Nigeria. He, therefore, urged residents of the state to vote for the PDP from top to bottom. Emenike Jeff, who led the defectors from Ugwuagu-Ndieto ward 2, Izzi local government area of the state, said their decision to join PDP was to support a candidate with good character for better Ebonyi and Nigeria at large. “When I was in APC, there were lots of things we saw, which I don’t like and as a peace-loving person, I have to leave to join the PDP. “I strongly believe in peace and we will join hands to deliver PDP in my  community and my local government,” he said.
