ABUJA – THE Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arraigned Rashida, wife of Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi State over alleged fraud. Also arraigned on Wednesday before a federal high court in Abuja was Ali Bello, identified as a nephew to the Kogi governor. In a statement by Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesperson, the agency said the duo were docked alongside three other persons on an 18-count charge “bordering on criminal misappropriation and money laundering to the tune of N3,081,804,654″.
