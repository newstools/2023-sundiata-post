By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – With just ten days to the general elections in Nigeria, the former Kaduna Central Senator, Comrade Shehu Sani has urged Nigerians to avoid all forms of protest and focus on the elections. He advised the citizens to resist anti-democratic elements whose intention is to leverage on protest in the name of cash or fuel scarcity to spark off conflagration. Sani, who made the call on Wednesday via his verified Twitter handle @ShehuSani, also admonished people in the South East to defy any call for seat at home. Shehu Sani said: “The general public must avoid any form of protest in d name of cash or fuel scarcity at this 11th hour. The people in d south east must defy any call for sit at home. Any spark is intended to lead to conflagration. Anti democratic elements must be resisted.Let’s focus on d election.” Since the introduction of the rebranded naira bills, Nigerians have been going through excruciating stress due to the non-availability of the new notes. Sundiata Post recalls that with just few days to the 10th of February deadline for the use of N200, N500 and N1000 old naira notes, the governors of Kaduna, Zamfara and Kogi states took the Federal Government to Supreme Court Over the naira redesign.
