The NHRC therefore solicited the full support and cooperation of all stakeholders (state governments, the Nigerian Military, the United Nations System, international and local non-governmental organisations and the traditional and religious institutions) in the humanitarian efforts in the north east for the Panel to achieve its mandate. Ojukwu commended the pledge by the Chief of Defence Staff that the military institution will cooperate with this investigation and the subsequent deployment of a Military Liaison to the secretariate of the Panel.
