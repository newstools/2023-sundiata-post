A 15-year-old boy, Yusuf Alabi, who stood in front of the convoy of Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi in Lagos on Saturday has given reason why he took the risky step. Obi was in Lagos for a mega rally to conclude his nationwide campaign for the February 25 election. In a post on Facebook, Yusuf said: “I stood in front of Peter Obi’s convoy because I wish I am up to 18 years old so that I can vote for him.
