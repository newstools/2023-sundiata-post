Damascus, – The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) reported that, at least 105 people died in Syrian opposition areas due to a strong earthquake on Monday morning. The Chairman of SAMS, Bassel Termanini, told dpa that the organisation covered about 50 per cent of the healthcare in the areas. Termanini said that he got reports that 105 people were killed so far, and more than 600 seriously injured, mainly in areas in the countrysides of Aleppo and Idlib. He added that the numbers were expected to rise as rescue operations continued and patients recovered from the rubble. Ibrahim al Haj, a spokesperson for the voluntary White Helmets rescue service in the countryside of Aleppo, told dpa, “We are in a disaster area, some of my family members are still under the rubble.” The injured are mainly suffering from skull fractures, broken legs and arms, he said.
