By Muhammad Nasir BashirDutse, – The Commissioner of Police (CP) in Jigawa, Mr Emmanuel Ekot, has barred all quasi-security outfits from election duties in the state. A statement by the command spokesman, DSP Lawan Shiisu on Friday in Dutse, said Ekot also warned political thugs to steer clear of the elections. According to him, all state-established and owned security outfits, organizations, quasi-security units and privately-owned guards and security outfits are barred from participating in election security. He also said that the police and other security agencies have been mandated to impose the restriction of movement order from 12am to 6pm on Saturday. The CP cautions politicians in the state against any act that would compromise peace and the electoral process. “In this regard, the command in collaboration with all security agencies across the state will work assiduously to fish out troublemakers and their sponsors, conduct thorough investigation and charge the culprits to court,” he added. Ekot warned security aides and escorts not to accompany their principals to polling units and collation centres as anyone found flouting the directive would be severely sanctioned. The CP assured law-abiding citizens of adequate security, saying they should turnout en masse and peacefully cast their votes. He advised all security personnel deployed for the exercise to be professional, civil, polite and shun any form of corrupt practice. According to Ekot, the Police will not allow undesirable elements to use the opportunity offered by the elections to foment trouble. (NAN)
