The African Union Commission has announced that it will be sending a 90-strong observer mission to Nigeria for this month?s elections. Nigeria goes to the polls on February 25, but has been plunged into crisis in the runup to the vote with fuel and cash shortage. The African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM)Â headed by former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta helped broker a deal to end two years of war in northern Ethiopia and is mediating in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The AU on Tuesday, February 14 said the objectives of the mission were to provide an ?accurate and impartial assessment? of the electoral process, offer recommendations for any improvement in future polls and to demonstrate AU support ?towards consolidation of democracy, peace, stability and development in Nigeria?.
