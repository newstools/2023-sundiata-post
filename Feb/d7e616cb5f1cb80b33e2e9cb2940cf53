Four days to the February 25 presidential election, Boot Party (BP) on Tuesday in Lagos announced the collapse of it’s structure into the Labour Party.

A delegation of the party’s national leadership met with the delegates of LP leadership, in a meeting chaired by PA Ayo Adebanjo in his Lekki, Lagos home. The Labour Party Governorship candidate for Lagos staete, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour was also in attendance to receive the Boot Party team. The party, which has strong footing in the southwest and some parts of the North, assured of their resolve to pull efforts and resources to deliver votes for Peter Obi. Also present were former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Mrs. Kofo Bucknor-Akerele and the party candidate for Governor in Lagos State, Wale Oluwo.
