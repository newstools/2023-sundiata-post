By CECILIA IJUO ABUJA- The Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Col. Hameed Ali (rtd) has disclosed that the service did not meet its 2022 revenue collection target. He made the disclosure on Thursday in Abuja while fielding questions from newsmen at a briefing to mark the end of a three-day global conference organised by the World Customs Organisation (WCO). Ali said the service had set a target of three trillion, one hundred billion naira (N3,100,000,000,000) but was able to generate two trillion, six hundred billion (N2,600,000,000,000) with a shortfall of over four hundred billion naira (N400, 000,000,000). He said factors such as unpredicted stock market and fiscal polices of government such as waivers and concessions led to the shortfall in revenue collection. The comptroller-general said “non-commencement of tariffs on carbonated drinks, telecommunications tariff, among other things, affected the actualisation of the service’s target for 2022.” He said the service was “hopeful that 2023 will be better if all these factors would be put in place. On the theme of the conference “Enabling Customs in Fragile and Conflict Affected Situations“, Ali said he was disturbed by the security challenges in border areas. He said besides efforts being made to get his personnel fully equipped for the job, the service was not resting on its oars to build their capacity for effective performance. Ali pledged to do everything to reposition the service. (NAN)
