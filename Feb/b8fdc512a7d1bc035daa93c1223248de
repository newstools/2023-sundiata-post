PORT HARCOURT – The Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Council has announced the cancellation of the rally of its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in Port Harcourt. “The presidential campaign planned early this week would no longer hold,” the PDP PCC Chairman in Rivers State, Senator Lee Maeba disclosed, citing insecurity. Senator Maeba stated, ”The expected victory of Atiku Abubakar does not worth the blood of any Rivers man or woman.” There has been increased tension in the state as the Governor, Nyesom Wike, disagreed with the national leadership of the party after the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as the presidential candidate of the PDP. Wike and four other governors of the party said their national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu must step aside for another chairman to emerge from the South. Earlier, Wike approved the state stadium for the rally and later cancelled the approval. He (Wike) alleged that Atiku was working with a faction of the All Progressives Congress in the state. However, after some back and forth, Wike reapproved the stadium as the venue of the rally, but the coordinators of Atiku’s Campaign in the state said they won’t use the place any longer.
