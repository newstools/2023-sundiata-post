ABUJA – Labour Party Presidential Candidate, Mr. Peter Obi, was yesterday, Tuesday, February 7, 2023, denied permission to land in Yobe State, thus aborting his campaign rally scheduled to hold in in Damaturu, the state capital. Obi disclosed this at a book presentation in his honour held yesterday afternoon at Ibeto Hotels, Apo, Abuja. He said in his short address at the event: “I was supposed to be in Yobe today to campaign but I wasn’t given approval to land in Yobe, which explains why I am in Abuja in the first place. I would have been speaking to you via Zoom if I was allowed to land and campaign in Yobe.” Obi and his running mate, Dr Datti Baba-Ahmed, had been scheduled to hold a rally at Summit Conference Hotel in Damaturu by 11am. However, “candidates of LP in the state and their loyalists waited for the arrival of Obi at the Muhammadu Buhari International Cargo Airport in Damaturu, but he did not show up,” according to a Daily Trust report. Addressing the supporters, Hajiya Hauwa Bukar, the North East Coordinator, Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, asked for forgiveness, saying their absence was not deliberate. She said the relevant agencies did not issue landing permit to Obi for the use of the airport Bukar said the International Cargo Airport had not been officially opened by the federal government. She added that another date would be fixed for the campaign.
