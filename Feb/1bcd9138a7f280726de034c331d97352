Abuja (Sundiata Post) Some hoodlums have attacked a Registration Area Centre (RAC) in the Tudun Wada area of Gombe State, robbing ad hoc staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The suspected thugs robbed the victims of their phones and injured some of the electoral officials who passed the night at a school, a few hours before the commencement of the Presidential/National Assembly polls. According to eyewitnesses, three injured persons were rushed to a nearby medical facility for treatment. The Gombe State Police Command confirmed the incident to Channels Television in a telephone conversation on Saturday. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Mahid Mu’azu Abubakar, said the ad-hoc staff went to the centre alone without waiting for security personnel that would accompany them. Abubakar, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, stated that the suspected thugs attacked the centre after sensing that the ad-hoc staff were vulnerable without security operatives to protect them. The police spokesperson said only one person – a female member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) – sustained injuries and was being treated at a hospital.
