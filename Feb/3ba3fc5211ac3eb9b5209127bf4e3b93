He is a unifier. He is a personality with proven ethnic and religious tolerance,” the former minister said. Adesiyan, who frowned at the introduction of new naira notes few weeks to the general elections, said that the policy had inflicted hardship on the people. He commended Tinubu for speaking out on the policy, assuring Nigerians that the APC Presidential candidate would correct all abnormalities when elected.
