By CHIMEZIE ANASO AWKA- The Court of Appeal sitting in Awka on Wednesday reserved ruling on the appeal filed by Sen. Victor Umeh of the Labour Party against his candidacy in the February election for Anambra Central Senatorial District. Justice Olubunmi Oyewole, the presiding Judge of the panel, announced this after counsel to the appellant and respondents adopted their written arguments. Oyewole said that the court would communicate the date for the judgment to the parties after going through their written addresses. Chief Alex Ejesieme SAN, LP counsel, who relied on his written appeal dated Feb. 7, prayed the court to uphold the appeal and set aside the judgement of the trial court for lack of locus. Ejesieme cited a number of Judgements on related matters including that of Justice Kolawole of the Court of Appeal sitting in Port Harcourt on Suit. No. CA/PH 480/2022 delivered on Nov. 29 on the case between PDP vs INEC and 11 others. He described the trial court judgment as “rather unfortunate“ in the light of the numerous decisions of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court on the subject matter. He also prayed the court to dismiss the preliminary objection filed by the respondents, saying it was ill conceived. Adopting his written argument, B.E.I Nwofor SAN, counsel to Ekwunife and the PDP prayed the Court to dismiss the appeal and sustain the judgement of the trial Court.(NAN)
