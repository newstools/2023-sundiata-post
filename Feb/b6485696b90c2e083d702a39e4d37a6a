By Chijioke Kingsley Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Rivers State South East Senatorial Candidate, Dr Douglas Fabeke has assured his supporters that his mandate will not be stolen or truncated in Rivers State. Fabeke said with the overwhelming support of votes he got from the zone, it cannot be compromised by the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP), in the State. Speaking in a press text on Monday in Rivers State, Fabeke called on his supporters to remain calm while they await the official announcement of the result from INEC. According to him: “Rivers South-east Senatorial District, thank you for your show of love and solidarity. I am humbled and honored by your massive support across the senatorial district. “Let me also use this medium to remind you that our mandate can never be stolen or denied. We are coasting to victory. Our liberation mandate shall be used to reclaim the economic, political and environmental marginalization of our people. “I am using this medium also, to call on all my teeming supporters to remain calm as we rightly follow up the process and make sure our liberation mandate is not compromised by our oppressors”, he said. Earlier our correspondent gathered that that was a source that a serious protest erupted at INEC Office in Bori LGA against criminal acts by INEC who have allowed themselves to be used by the Governor of the State Nyesom Wike’s faction of the PDP to subvert the will of the people. According to the source: “The people are standing up to say No, enough is enough, this country is no longer a place where you think you can do anything and get away with it. If the right thing is not done, this protest can grow bigger and bigger”, our correspondent gathered.
