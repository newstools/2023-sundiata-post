A bag containing permanent voter cards (PVCs) was brought to a radio station by some unidentified hunters in Anambra State on Tuesday. In a video shared by Tunde Ednut, a lady a member of staff of the Authority FM was heard saying that some two men found the PVCs at a place in the east called Akamiri forest in Anambra State and brought it to their radio station. Speaking further she affirmed that the PVCs are close to one million and after checking they found out that they belonged to the people of Nnewi North, as she urged everyone to tell their friends, neighbours, and well-wishers who could not collect their card to come to their office for collection. Moreso, she disclosed that the PVCs were wrapped inside a bag that is already going bad as she maintained that it must have been kept there for a long time.In conclusion, she, however, pleaded with Nigerians to help spread the video so that people who are looking for their cards can be aware and come to collect them because the election is on Saturday.
