By SEGUN GIWA AKURE- A Yoruba Sociocultural Group, Yoruba Ronu, on Friday said most Nigerians were not happy over the lingering scarcity of petrol and new naira notes. The Chairman of the Group, Prince Diran Iyantan, stated this in an interview with journalists in Akure. Iyantan, who noted that as the electioneering ahead of the general election was coming to an end, said some Nigerians were in a state of despondency due to poor living conditions. He commended efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari at improving on the welfare of the citizens. The Yoruba Ronu leader also expressed concerns over alleged conspiratorial plot in some quarters to deny the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the presidency. Iyantan said that he was sure President Buhari would not be involved in such plot, saying, ”no president in the history of the world will ever want an opposition party to succeed him.” He noted the current fuel and the new naira notes scarcity were affecting the economy and causing hardship to the citizens. “There are several who think this is some sort of vast conspiratorial plot on the part of the ruling party to deny Asiwaju Tinubu the presidency as Tinubu himself gave a sly conspiratorial wink at Abeokuta during his campaign in Ogun State recently. “President Muhammadu Buhari is a true party man and is wise enough to know it is in his best interest for Bola Tinubu to be his successor so as to protect his good work and continue from where he stopped than for another political party to destroy all his legacies,” Iyantan said. He appealed to banks to ensure that the new naira notes were abundantly available for Nigerians to access. The group begged Nigerians to keep their renewed hope for Tinubu “as the man that will turn things around for them”. (NAN)
