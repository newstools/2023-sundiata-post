U.S – Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram pages have been restored more than two years after he was banned following January 6  Capitol Riot. Meta reactivated the accounts after telling the former president in January that he was free to return as long as he played by the rules.h His last Facebook on January 6, 2021. was: ‘I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order ? respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!’ Elon Musk has also reinstated his Twitter account, but Trump has not yet posted on it. In January, Meta’s president of global affairs Nick Clegg said Trump was free to use Twitter again as long as he played by the rules. ‘We’re trying to strike a balance between keeping people safe on our platform, making sure that our services are not used to threaten real would harm, but at the same time we think the American people should hear from those who want to lead them, and we don’t want to stand in the way of that’.
