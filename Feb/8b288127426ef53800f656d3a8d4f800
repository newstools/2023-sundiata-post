Singers Seun Kuti and Peter Okoye of PSquare are tackling themselves online. It all started when Seun in a recent interview said the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, is an ??opportunist and not the messiah” Nigerians think he is. His statement did not go well with Peter who is a staunch supporter of Mr. Obi. In response, Peter said Seun has erased his father, Fela’s history, for making such a comment. They have since taken to their Instastories to tackle each other, with Seun sharing a photo of Peter seated beside billionaire businessman, Aliko Dangote. See their posts below?
