According to Barunde: “The NSCDC assures the general public of the readiness and preparedness of personnel to adhere strictly to the electoral Act, rules of engagement for the conduct of elections and other extant laws of the land. “Citizens are encouraged to exercise their civic rights without any fear of molestation and conduct themselves in a peaceful manner worthy of patriots. “They are also urged to report any suspected persons, groups of persons and movements that could lead to breach of peace, breakdown of law and order or spark electoral violence”, he said. “Barunde warns all miscreants to eschew forthwith whatever plans that might be conceived to cause trouble before, during and or after the process as the long arm of the law will definitely catch up with them”.
