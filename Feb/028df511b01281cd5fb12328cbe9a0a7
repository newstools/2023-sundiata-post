The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, says the current scarcity of fuel and naira notes is the handiwork of sabotuers. Gbajabiamila made this known at a political gathering in Lagos state on Tuesday, February 14. He said the fuel crisis and the lingering scarcity of naira notes were carefully orchestrated by some elements to derail the successes of the Buhari-led administration to achieve political motive. He stated that the House of Representatives is working hard to rescue citizens from the current hardships towards bringing relief as soon as possible. ?As your representative and Speaker, I have a good understanding of the current hardships and discomfort being faced by many Nigerians, without exception to  my constituents. The lower legislative chamber under my leadership has been on the side of the people, working tirelessly to rescue them from these difficulties. I am glad that the judiciary has also confirmed our position on the implementation of  the policy of  naira redesign ? He said the naira swap policy was a  well-thought-out plan that has unfortunately been hijacked and politicized. He alleged that some elements had created a crisis around the policy just to stop the All Progressives Congress(APC ) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, from winning the presidential election . According to him, the plot seemed to be failing as Nigerians are still ?keeping faith with the APC and Tinubu in spite of what they were going through.? ?Nobody can convince me that it is not a plot to stop Asiwaju from becoming the president of this country . But I am glad that our God is a wonderful being, as the plot these people sat together to hatch he  has intervened .?
