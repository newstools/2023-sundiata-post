The uploading of election results on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) results viewing portal for Saturdayâ€™s Presidential and National Assembly has commenced. Sundiata Post recalls that James Abure, the national chairman of Labour Party earlier Saturday evening raised an alarm that INEC flouting promise made on uploading results of elections in different polling units across the country specifically Lagos and Delta States as they are sorted, counted, and collated. Recall on November 22, the INEC chairman, Yakubu Mahmoud, said there is no going back on its decision to upload the results of the 2023 general elections on its portal to enable Nigerians to have a real-time view of the results as they are being collated.
