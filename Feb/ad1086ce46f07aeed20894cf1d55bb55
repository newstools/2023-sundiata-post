Pyeongtaek (South Korea) – Head of an affiliate of food and beverage giant SPC Group is standing trial  over the death of a young worker at its factory in 2022, police said. SPL CEO Kang Dong-Seok was on Thursday charged for failing to fulfill his duty to implement safety measures. According to the Pyeongtaek Police Station, failure to install safety measures resulted to the death of the 23-year-old employee at the bread factory in Pyeongtaek, Seoul, on Oct. 15. The worker was using a large-sized mixer to make sauces for sandwiches when her upper body was caught in the mixer, police said. While four other SPL factory managers were also referred to the prosecution for alleged professional negligence resulting to the worker’s death, they said. She was working alone at time of the accident, although guidelines specify that two people must work as one team, police said, adding that belated rescue as the cause of her death. However, the labor ministry is investigating SPC Group Chairman Heo Young-in and Kang for allegedly violating the disaster law. (Yonhap/NAN)
