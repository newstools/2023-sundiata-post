By PETER UWUMAROGIE GOMBE- The Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of Zone 12, Bauchi, Olawale Olokode has charged police personnel to carry out their jobs with human face and fear of God. Olokode gave the charge on while addressing officers and men of the command during his visit to the Police Command Headquarters, in Gombe on Friday. He said men of the command ought to police with civility knowing that they have a duty to serve the people with professionalism, dignity and respect for human rights. According to him, police officers must be friendly and diplomatic in their dealings with the public to earn the trust and confidence of the people. “You police in a way that it will have human face and also have the fear of God while doing your job. This makes the police more responsible and acceptable within the community. “There is no how we can police the society if they do not have trust in us. “I remember during the ENDSARS protest, there were police stations and officers that were even protected by the community, that is the reward for human face policing,” he said. Olokode urged the policemen to accord priority to compassion in the course of community service. “My vision is to make police within the zone, a leading national, professional and efficient law enforcement organisation. “A police force that is dynamic, robust and efficient; one that never rests or abdicate its professional duty that studies and analyses what works and what does not, acknowledges and learns from its mistakes and celebrate its victory.” While cautioning officers against exposing themselves to attack, the AIG advised thes to always carry out proper background assessment before going out to work. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Oqua Etim said Gombe State had remained peaceful in view of the collective and collaborative efforts of all stakeholders. Etim assured that his men were motivated and trained to keep fit for the task of securing the state. (NAN)
