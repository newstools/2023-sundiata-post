By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – The Supreme Court sitting in Abuja, today, Monday, 27th February, 2023 has upheld the earlier ruling of the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division which declared Hon Chijioke Edeoga as the authentic Labour Party Governorship Candidate of Enugu State. The Apex Court presided over by Justice Kekere Ekun described Mr. Everestus Nnaji (Odengene) as a meddlesome interloper who shouldn’t have gone to court in the first place, since he didn’t participate in the Labour Party Governorship Primaries abnitio. The Court agreed with the Lead Counsel representing the Labour Party; Alex Ejesieme, SAN and M.J Numa, SAN that the Appellant contention at the trial court culminating into the Appeal was against Public Policy as the Appellant lacked the requisite Locus Standi. Honourable Dennis Agbo, a stakeholder in the state while in his reaction to pronouncement of the Supreme Court noted that further contention for the rightful holder of the ticket had buried. “The stage is now set for Honourable Chijioke Edeoga to begin to prepare for his inauguration as the next governor of the state come May 29, 2023.” Honourable Agbo stressed. Honourable Agbo who has also won his election as the representative of Udenu/Igboeze North Federal Constituency on the platform of Labour Party for the House of Representatives believed that with what happened in the Presidential/National Assembly elections last Saturday, the people of Enugu have demonstrated their rejection of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) in the state. “Our people are tired of the misrule of PDP in Enugu State and they have eloquently voiced that with what happened last Saturday” . He further stressed He thanked the people of Udenu/Igboeze North Federal Constituency for their votes and promised to reenact what he did for them in the 8th Assembly which according to him was quality representation. Governorship Elections in Enugu State slated for 11th day of March, 2023.
