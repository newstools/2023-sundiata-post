By AKOJEDE OLANREWAJU LAGOS- The Programme Director, Timilehin Leukemia Foundation (TLF), Mrs Oluwadamilola Oyedunle, on Monday,said Lagos State needed about 10 per cent of its residents as blood donors to save lives. She made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the sidelines of the Valentine’s Day Blood Donation Driveheld at Textile Labour House, Acme Road, Ogba. She said having such percentage of blood donors in the state would ensure adequate blood in the banks. According to her, Lagos has yet to attain a minimum 10 per cent of its citizens for blood donations for a densely populated state. Oyedunle added that “the goal is to have blood banks in each local government where five to 10 people will walk into health facilitiesand donate blood. “We are looking forward to a point where patients who need blood can get into any facility around Lagos and get it without stress.” The programme director also said that the TLF as an organisation had been able to save many lives through its intervention programmes. She said “one of the things we find joy in is saving lives through encouraging voluntary blood donation; this is more paramount and noble than making money. “We are trying to get more sponsors for our programmes; we need more corporate sponsors to help the health sector.” The convener of the Valentine’s Day Blood Donation Drive, Mrs Janet Oyedele, described the exercise as fruitful, sayingit would go a long way in saving the lives of patients in need of blood. She commended the blood donors for their efforts, adding that the act is noble. NAN reports that the Valentine’s Day Blood Donation Drive was supported by Fidson Pharmaceutical Ltd and theLagos State Blood Transfusion Department. (NAN)
