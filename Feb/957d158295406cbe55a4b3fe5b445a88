By DIANA OMUEZA ABUJA- The Action Alliance (AA) has denied the purported endorsement of Sen. Philip Aduda of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Senatorial seat in 2023 general election.This is contained in a statement signed on Wednesday in Abuja, by Mrs Gloria Vernimbe, AA FCT Chairperson.Vernimbe said that the purported endorsement was maliciously done by unknown elements claiming to be members of the party.“The general public, the media, especially Channels Television and Sen. Philip Aduda in particular should disregard such purported endorsement.“This is because it did not emanate from the FCT chapter of Action Alliance and our party has its senatorial candidate in the FCT in person of Prof. Ejie Jidejisos Josiah.“The party is hopeful of wining the senatorial seat in the FCT,” she said.She urged the party members and supporters in the FCT to remain calm.Vernimbe urged them to be peaceful and prepare to exercise their civic right in the Feb. 25 General Election in order to elect their prefered candidates in the general election.(NAN)
