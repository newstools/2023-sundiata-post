By AFUSAT AGUNBIADE-OLADIPO ILORIN- The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Kwara, Malam Attahiru Madami, says the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) is not for voting, but to verify and authenticate the owner of voters card.Madami made the clarification during a stakeholders meeting at the commission’s office in Ilorin on Thursday.He said that the meeting was very important especially for the political parties to embark on voter education. The official explained that there won’t be over voting with the use of BVAS for accreditation.He warned that if the presiding officer of any polling unit is mischievous and allow people to vote without verification by BVAS, such person would be arrested and prosecuted.“Assuming the the total number of people registered through accreditation is 300 and the ballot paper counted is 301, the result of that polling unit will be cancelled.“It means that all the political parties in the affected polling unit will get zero,” the REC said.“If your finger was put on the BVAS and your finger print match, you are going to vote, but if your fringer print doesn’t match but face match you are going to vote.“However, if your face and finger print was put three times and both doesn’t match, it means you cannot vote,” Madami explained.He therefore advised the representatives of political parties to draw the ears of their political agents to be vigilant during election. (NAN)
