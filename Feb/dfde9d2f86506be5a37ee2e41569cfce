By JACINTA NWACHUKWU  FCT- Some voters at Gwagwalada Area Council have expressed concern over their inability to find their names on the INEC voters’ list. They expressed the concern in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday at Gwagwalada. Mrs Amina Yusuf, a nursing mother at the UBE Primary School, New Kutunku Ward told NAN that she came as early as 8.00 am to vote but could not find her name. Another person at Deeper Life Ward, New Kutunku, Mr David Adejo said that he had been to four polling stations within the ward to check his name without success. “It is frustrating, I  don’t know what to do again and I really want to vote,” Adejo said. Ms Jane Nwosu while expressing disappointment,  said that she registered at New Kutunku Ward but was asked to go to Radio House polling station to check for her name. “I did not get any information before now on where to go for the  voting, I have gone round the wards without finding my name,” she said. However, apart from the issue, the voting process went smoothly. Also, at the council movement of vehicles and motorcycles were not restricted as people were seen moving around on motorcycles as well as private cars. (NAN)
