By EBERE AGOZIE ABUJA- The Supreme Court on Friday affirmed Mr Agbu Kefas as the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Taraba . Justice Emmanuel Agim dismissed the appeal brought before it by Prof. Jerome Nyameh challenging the May 25, 2022 Taraba governorship primary election that produced Kefas as its  flagbearer of the party. The appeal by  Nyameh was dismissed by the apex court on the grounds that he failed to explore the internal mechanism for peaceful resolution of primary election before rushing to court to institute the suit. Agim, who read the unanimous judgment of the court held that Nyameh also failed to join other aspirants that participated in the primary election as defendants as required by law. The apex court said that the law was clear on conditions precedent to be complied with before any aggrieved governorship aspirant can rush to court. (NAN)
