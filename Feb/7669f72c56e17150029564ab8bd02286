Rivers State, – The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike says the G5  within the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is not dead but will act on its plan for the February 25, 2023 presidential election. The G5 is made up of five aggrieved governors of the PDP in southern Nigeria including Wike, Samuel Ortom (Benue), Seyi Makinde (Oyo), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia), and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu). The five governors have been consistent in their demand that Iyorchia Ayu step down as PDP national chairman as a precondition for them to support the presidential ambition of the party?s flag bearer, Atiku Abubakar. Speaking on Tuesday, February 14 during the party?s governorship campaign in the Ahoada East Local Government Area of the state Wike said; ?They said G5 is dead. What is their problem? Why are they concerned?? Wike queried ?They don?t know there is a time to talk and there is a time to take action in politics. The action is on February 25. They can?t know our plans even if they push us. The more you look, the less you see,? he said. ?None of the vultures can withstand me and talk. Nobody can sell Rivers State for a pot of porridge.? Speaking on the cancellation of the presidential rally of Atiku in Rivers, the governor said the PDP presidential candidate never loved the state in the first place. Wike said, ?When they said they cancelled the rally, it is a lie; they don?t want to tell us that they can?t mobilise. In any case, PDP hasn?t told us that they love Rivers State. ?We had a problem here; heavy flood that occupied our houses. Did anybody whether the PDP (presidential) candidate or any leadership of the party, did they come to sympathise with us? But they went to Bayelsa, went to Delta. They showed us they don?t love us. No problem but our destiny is in our hands. Nobody can force us to anything.?
