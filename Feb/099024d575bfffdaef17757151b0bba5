Abuja (Sundiata Post) -The Osun State https://sundiatapost.com/one-dead-five-arrested-as-apc-pdp-clash-in-jigawa/Government has declared what it terms the 2023 annual Valentine’s Day Celebration. The government made this known in a circular sent to Secretary to the State Government, the Chief of Staff and all ministries in the state. The circular dated 10 Feb. 2023 was signed by the Osun Head of Service, K. N. Akintola. It reads in part: “The year 2023 annual Valentine Day Celebration for the entire Public Servants in the state comes up on Tuesday 14th February 2023 at White House Car Park, Abere. The programme will feature table tennis, draft, ayo olopon, ludo, dressing parade, dancing competition, questions and answers among others.“The Executive Governor, Osun State, His Excellency, Senator Ademola Jackson Nurudeen Adeleke is the Father of Love for the day while the Head of Service is the Chief Host. Therefore, all members of staff are to be seated by 10:00 am.” The circular also requests “all Accounting Officers of Ministries, Departments and Agencies and Heads of non-Ministerial Agencies including Local Government as well as Local Council Development Authorities to comply and give the content of this circular wide publicity among their staff.” However, the unusual circular has made some concerned citizens of the state question the competence and seriousness of Governor Adeleke in stirring the affairs of the state at a time like this. A prominent figure in the state on Friday said “Finally, Osun state enters one chance with a dancing governor who has no clue on what governance is all about!”
