By SAM JONES YENAGOA (Sundiata Post) – Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State has warned moles in his government to resign now or be shown the way out, as he kicked off a statewide medical outreach at Igeibiri community in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of the state. Diri disclosed that some of his appointees were dropping his name that he was supporting candidates of other parties other than the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidates. Before giving the warning, he had assured he was not campaigning, but said such appointees cannot be benefiting from a PDP government and working against the interests of the party. His words: “I learnt that some people are dropping my name that I am supporting other candidates other than the PDP candidates. If you are in such a group, resign now or I will show you the way out. “You cannot be eating from PDP and working against PDP,” the governor stated. Diri, on the same day, also commissioned the Judges Quarters and handed it over to the Bayelsa State Judiciary. No fewer than 72 communities in Bayelsa State will benefit from the medical outreach organised by the government as part of activities marking Governor Douye Diri’s three years in office. Three communities have been selected in each of the 24 state constituencies to benefit from the medical outreach which was kicked off by Governor Diri at Igeibiri community in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area. The medical team will be in each community for two days as the governor disclosed that the medical outreach is a government programme that started in 2019. He promised to build a primary health centre at Igeibiri community and urged the people to take advantage of the outreach advising them not to give money to anybody to benefit from the programme.
