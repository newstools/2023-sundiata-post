The Head, Media and Publicity, EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren disclosed this in a statement which was made available to newsmen. Uwujaren noted that this discovery, which indicated a sabotage of the government’s monetary policy by some banks, was made by the EFCC in continuation of the ongoing surveillance and visit to banks across the country to access their vaults and verify whether they were deliberately refusing to dispense the redesigned naira notes. He said, “More than five bank branches were covered on Monday by the EFCC operatives in Abuja, similar exercises are ongoing in zonal commands across the country. “The operation will continue until normalcy is restored to the banking system. “Nigerians finding it difficult to access their funds at any bank and suspects foul play should contact the commission, for immediate intervention.”
