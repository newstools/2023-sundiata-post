Lagos State – The Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has reacted to losing Lagos state to Peter Obi of the Labour Party in last Saturday, February 25, presidential election. Obi polled 582,454 votes to trounce the former Lagos State governor who scored 572,606 votes. In a statement released by the director of Media and Publicity of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Bayo Onanuga, Tinubu said he is bound to accept the outcome of the just-concluded election as a Democrat. According to him, Peter Obi’s victory in the state shows the beauty of democracy. The former Lagos state governor warned his followers to be calm and maintain peace, saying Obi’s victory in Lagos should not be a source of provocation. “As s a democrat he is bound to accept the outcome of any election whether favourable or not,” the statement read Tinubu condemned the reported attacks on some traders of Igbo origin in the state following Obi’s electoral victory in the state. “The fact that the APC narrowly lost Lagos State to another party should not be the reason for violence. As a democrat, you win some, you lose some. We must allow the process to continue unhindered across the country while we maintain peace and decorum,” the statement said. (LINDA IKEJI)
