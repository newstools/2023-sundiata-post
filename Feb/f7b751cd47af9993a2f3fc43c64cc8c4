By (Sundiata Post) – The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has disowned a document indicating that it had concluded plans to shift the date for the presidential and national assembly elections from February 25 to March 4. The document dated Feb. 13 had indicated that INEC decided to shift the date for the election because of the current scarcity of cash in the country as a result of the new Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) policy limiting daily withdrawal and availability of the newly redesigned N200, N500 and N1000 notes. But INEC, in message on its Twitter handle titled: “fake news alert” on Monday night described the claim that INEC is planning to postpone the election as false. “Our attention has been drawn to a fake report circulating on the social media with the title: ‘INEC May Postpone Feb. 25 Election by a week or two. “The commission will not and is not contemplating postponing the 2023 General Election. Nigerians should disregard it,” INEC said.
