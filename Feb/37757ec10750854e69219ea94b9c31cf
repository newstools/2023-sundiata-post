By NICHOLAS DECHI MAKURDI- The governorship candidate, All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue, Rev. Fr. Hyacinth Alia, has urged Nigerians to vote for the party’s presidential candidate, Sen. Bola Tinubu and all the party’s National Assembly candidates. This is contained in a statement signed by his Director of Communications, Mr Tersoo Kula and issued on Tuesday in Makurdi. Alia made the appeal on Monday at Tor-Donga, Katsina-Ala Local Government Area  of the state during a campaign in the area. “I beg you to come out en masse this Saturday and vote Tinubu as president of Nigeria. “I assure you, Tinubu is the only person I believe will answer me anytime I knock at his door. So, just do me this favour by voting for him,” he pleaded. Alia said that people tagging Tinubu/Shettima as Muslim-Muslim ticket were mischievous and out to confuse Nigerians to their own advantage. He said  that Tinubu’s wife was not only a Christian but a pastor, stressing that he did not Islamise her and her children. “So, why would one think he will Islamise Nigeria? This is mischief, pure and simple,” he said. He promised to wipe their tears if voted into office, emphasising that they would not regret voting him and all APC candidates. Alia promised to give honest and profitable amnesty to militia and other criminal elements in the state if elected governor. (NAN)
