By Amen Gajira Kafanchan, – Mr Dan Amos, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Jema’a/Sanga Federal Constituency, says the party will provide purposeful leadership if given the mandate at all levels of governance in the forthcoming 2023 elections. Amos, who made the known while speaking with newsmen at a PDP campaign rally for its Southern Kaduna candidates in Kafanchan, said Nigeria was in dire need of effective, all-inclusive and responsive leadership. He noted that a vote for the PDP candidates in the zone and across Nigeria was a vote for prosperity and progress of the country. “We are promising good and purposeful leadership; very deliberate leadership that is required at this time. “You can see the economic hardship and division along ethnic and religious lines that Nigerians are facing. “So, the PDP is coming to correct all of these anomalies and that is what I and all others in the PDP represent,” he added. The candidate expressed optimism that the PDP would sweep the polls ‘because the people are yearning for a change’. On his legislative blueprint, Amos promised to initiate legislations that would improve the socio-economic wellbeing of his constituents and the Nigerian people at large. He also emphasized on giving priority to programmes that would empower women and youths in order to make them self-reliant. He added that as a former council chairman of Jema’a, he would bring his capacity and wealth of experience to bear in the affairs of the constituency. “The job requires someone with capacity, commitment and experience and that is exactly what I will be bringing to the table,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that some of the candidates and stakeholders who spoke at the rally maintained that the PDP was the party to beat in the polls. They enjoined the people of the area not to allow themselves to be distracted and divided by other parties as Southern Kaduna remained a stronghold of the PDP. (NAN)
