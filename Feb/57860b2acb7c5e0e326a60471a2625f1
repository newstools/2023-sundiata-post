ABUJA – About 87.2 million Nigerians representing about 93.3 per cent of the total registered voters are expected to vote during the 2023 general elections out of the 93.4 million registered voters. Figures released on Thursday by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), which also indicates that about 6.2 million registered voters “failed” to collect their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs), the only qualification for Nigerians to vote in the exercise. Mahmood Yakubu, INEC Chairman, who presented the figures at a briefing ahead of the elections, on Thursday, said about 13.6 million new PVCs were printed for those who registered newly or applied to transfer their voters cards or requested replacement. The revelation by the INEC boss, finally put to rest the outcry by some Nigerians that hours to the crucial commencement of the crucial polls, with the presidential and National Assembly scheduled for February 25 and the governorship and state assemblies for March 11, Nigerians were yet to get the figures of those participating. It also comes few weeks after the closure of the collection of the PVCs with many Nigerians complaining of inability to collect their own due to alleged sharp practices of INEC officials, some of whom demanded monetary inducement.
