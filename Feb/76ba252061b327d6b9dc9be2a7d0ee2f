CALABAR (Sundiata Post) – It was a major boost for the Labour Party at the weekend in Cross River State as the All Progressives Congress, APC heavyweight in Cross River state, Senator M. T. Mbu Jr. dumped the party and declared for the Labour Party. Senator Mbu who was the unifier-in-chief for the crisis-ridden APC in the state and who was the architect of Governor Ben Ayade leaving PDP for APC, says he is now Obidient. Sundiata Post gathered that Sen Mbu said he was joining the Obidient movement because it’s becoming very obvious that they are the only ones who can restore the much-needed peace, unity, and progress In Nigeria. The distinguished Senator also believes that the Obi-Datti team is the only one that can restore a bright future for Nigerian youths. Sundiata Post reports Senator Mbu is a big addition to the growing Obidient movement because he has a huge following in Cross River State.
